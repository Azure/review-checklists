Enable Application Insights when creating online deployments.Monitor training infrastructure and review resource usage such as memory and CPU or GPU usage when training models to ensure you're meeting your baseline requirements.",
            "description": "Monitoring endpoints gives you visibility into metrics such as request latency and requests per minute. You can compare your performance versus your baseline and use this information to make changes to compute resources accordingly. Monitoring metrics such as network bytes can alert you if you're approaching quota limits and prevent throttling.Likewise, monitoring your training environment provides you with the information to make changes to your training environment. Use that information to decide to scale in or out, scale up or down with different performant SKUs, or choose between CPUs or GPUs.",
