An ExpressRoute circuit allows a private dedicated connection into Azure with the help of a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute Direct allows you to extend the on-premises network directly into the Microsoft network at a peering location. You also need to identify the bandwidth requirement and the SKU type requirement for your business needs.",
