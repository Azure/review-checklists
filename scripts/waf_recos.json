Taking 32 instance IP addresses + 1 private front-end IP + 5 Azure reserved, a minimum subnet size of /26 is recommended. Because the Standard_v2 or WAF_v2 SKU can support up to 125 instances, using the same calculation, a subnet size of /24 is recommended.- If you want to deploy additional Application Gateway resources in the same subnet, consider the additional IP addresses that will be required for their maximum instance count for both, Standard and Standard v2.",
