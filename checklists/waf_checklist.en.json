This question is typically asked in the context of a C# function that does an async operation and waits for the result, e.g. await Task.Delay(1000) or await client.GetAsync('http://google.com').

What actually happens over that time in terms of CPU activity is not factored into the calculation.One exception to this rule is if you are using durable functions.
