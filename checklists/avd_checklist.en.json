Three possible in-region DR strategies are possible, it is recommended to select the best one based on cost, RTO/RPO, and if it is really necessary to save the entire VM OS disk: (1) create each session host in a specific zone (AZ) and then use Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to replicate to a different zone. (2) Use Azure Backup to backup and restore the specific session host in a different AZ. (3) Create a new session host in a different AZ and rely on FSLogix and/or OneDrive to make data and settings available on the new machine. All options require administrator intervention for DR and direct user assignment at Host Pool level, then must be planned and configured in advance.",
