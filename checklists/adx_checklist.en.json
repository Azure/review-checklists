Changes in the leader, such as create, append, and drop are automatically synchronized to the follower. While the leaders could span Azure regions, the follower clusters should be hosted in the same region(s) as the leader. If the leader cluster is down or databases or tables are accidentally dropped, the follower clusters will lose access until access is recovered in the leader.",
