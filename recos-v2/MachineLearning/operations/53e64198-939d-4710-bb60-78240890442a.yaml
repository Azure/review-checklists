description: Use Machine Learning model registries to store and version your machine
  learning models to track changes and maintain lineage with the job and datasets
  used for training. With Machine Learning model catalogs, your data science teams
  can discover, evaluate, and fine tune pretrained foundational machine learning models.
  Storing versioned models in Machine Learning model registries supports deployment
  strategies such as A/B releases, canary releases, and rollbacks.
