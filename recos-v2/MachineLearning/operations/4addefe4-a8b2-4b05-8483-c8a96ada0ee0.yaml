description: Curated environments are pre-created environments provided by Machine
  Learning that speed up deployment time and reduce deployment and training latency.
  Using curated environments improves training and deployment success rates and avoids
  unnecessary image builds. Curated environments, such as Azure Container for PyTorch,
  can also be optimized for training large models on Machine Learning.
