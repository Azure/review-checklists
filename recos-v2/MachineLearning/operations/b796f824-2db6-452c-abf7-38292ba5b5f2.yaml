title: 'Automate for efficiency: Follow good machine learning operations (MLOps) practices.
  When possible, build end-to-end automated pipelines for data preparation, training,
  and scoring processes. In development, use scripts instead of notebooks for training
  models, as scripts are easier to integrate into automated pipelines.'
