description: Selecting the right compute is critical as it directly impacts the cost
  of running your workload. Choosing a GPU or a high-performance SKU without proper
  usage can lead to wasteful spending, while choosing undersized compute can lead
  to prohibitively long training times and performance problems.

title: "Optimize compute resources: Optimize your compute resources based on the requirements\
  \ of your workload. Choose the SKU that best suits your workload:<ul><li>General\
  \ Purpose \u2013 Balanced CPU to memory ratio, good for all purposes.</li><li>Compute\
  \ Optimized \u2013 High CPU to memory ratio, good for math-heavy computations.</li><li>Memory\
  \ Optimized \u2013 High memory to CPU, good for in-memory computations or database\
  \ applications.</li><li>M Series \u2013 Very large machines that have huge amounts\
  \ of memory and CPU. </li><li> GPU \u2013 Better for models with a high number of\
  \ variables that can benefit from higher parallelism and specialized core instructions.\
  \ Typical applications are deep learning, image or video processing, scientific\
  \ simulations, data mining, and taking advantage of GPU development frameworks.\
  \ Test with multiple families and document the results as your baseline. As your\
  \ model and data evolve, the most adequate compute resource might change. Monitor\
  \ execution times and reevaluate as needed."
