title: As a part of your backup and recovery strategy, enable the container soft delete,
  blob soft delete, versioning, and point-in-time restore options.
description: The soft delete option enables a storage account to recover deleted containers
  and blobs. The versioning option automatically tracks changes made to blobs. This
  option lets you restore a blob to a previous state.The point-in-time restore option
  protects against accidental blob deletion or corruption and lets you restore block
  blob data to an earlier state. For more information, see Data protection overview.
