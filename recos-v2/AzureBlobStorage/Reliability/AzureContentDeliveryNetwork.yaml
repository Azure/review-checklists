title: 'Use failure mode analysis: Minimize points of failure by considering internal
  dependencies such as the availability of virtual networks, Azure Key Vault, or Azure
  Content Delivery Network or Azure Front Door endpoints. Failures can occur if credentials
  required by workloads to access Blob Storage go missing from Key Vault, or if workloads
  use an endpoint based on a content delivery network that''s removed. In these cases,
  workloads might need to use an alternative endpoint to connect. For general information
  about failure mode analysis, see Recommendations for performing failure mode analysis.'
