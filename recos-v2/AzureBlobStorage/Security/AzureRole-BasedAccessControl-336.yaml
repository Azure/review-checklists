title: Authorize access by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC).
description: With RBAC, there are no passwords or keys that can be compromised. The
  security principal (user, group, managed identity, or service principal) is authenticated
  by Microsoft Entra ID to return an OAuth 2.0 token. The token is used to authorize
  a request against the Blob Storage service.
