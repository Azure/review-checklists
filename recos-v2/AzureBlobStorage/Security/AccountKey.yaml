title: We recommend that you don't use an account key. If you must use account keys,
  then store them in Key Vault, and make sure that you regenerate them periodically.
description: Key Vault lets you retrieve keys at runtime, instead of saving them by
  using your application. Key Vault also makes it easy to rotate your keys without
  interruption to your applications. Rotating the account keys periodically reduces
  the risk of exposing your data to malicious attacks.
