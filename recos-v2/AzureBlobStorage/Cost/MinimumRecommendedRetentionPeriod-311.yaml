name: MinimumRecommendedRetentionPeriod-311
title: If you enable soft delete, then place blobs that are frequently overwritten
  into an account that doesn't have soft delete enabled. Set retention periods. Consider
  starting with a short retention period to better understand how the feature affects
  your bill. The minimum recommended retention period is seven days.
description: Every time a blob is overwritten, a new snapshot is created. The cause
  of increased capacity charges might be difficult to access because the creation
  of these snapshots doesn't appear in logs. To reduce capacity charges, store frequently
  overwritten data in a separate storage account with soft delete disabled. A retention
  period keeps soft-deleted blobs from piling up and adding to the cost of capacity.
