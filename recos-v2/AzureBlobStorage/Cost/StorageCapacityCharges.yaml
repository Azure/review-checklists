title: If you enable versioning, then place blobs that are frequently overwritten
  into an account that doesn't have versioning enabled.
description: Every time a blob is overwritten, a new version is added which leads
  to increased storage capacity charges. To reduce capacity charges, store frequently
  overwritten data in a separate storage account with versioning disabled.
