title: 'Achieve performance: Determine when to use fine-tuning before you commit to
  fine-tuning. Although there are good use cases for fine-tuning, such as when the
  information needed to steer the model is too long or complex to fit into the prompt,
  make sure that prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches
  don''t work or are demonstrably more expensive.'
