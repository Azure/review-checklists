title: 'Adjust usage: Optimize prompt input and response length. Longer prompts raise
  costs by consuming more tokens. However, prompts that are missing sufficient context
  don''t help the models yield good results. Create concise prompts that provide enough
  context for the model to generate a useful response. Also ensure that you optimize
  the limit of the response length.'
