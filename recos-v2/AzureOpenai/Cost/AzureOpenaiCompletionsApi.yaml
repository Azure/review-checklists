title: 'Design client code to set limits: Your custom clients should use the limit
  features of the Azure OpenAI completions API, such as maximum limit on the number
  of tokens per model (`max_tokens`) or number of completions to generation (`n`).
  Setting limits ensures that the server doesn''t produce more than the client needs.'
description: Using API features to restrict usage aligns service consumption with
  client needs. This saves money by ensuring the model doesn't generate an overly
  long response that consumes more tokens than necessary.
