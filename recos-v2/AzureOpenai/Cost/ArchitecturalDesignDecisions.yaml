title: 'Monitor pay-as-you-go usage: If you use the pay-as-you-go approach, monitor
  usage of TPM and RPM. Use that information to inform architectural design decisions
  such as what models to use, and to optimize prompt sizes.'
description: Continuously monitoring TPM and RPM gives you relevant metrics to optimize
  the cost of Azure OpenAI models. You can couple this monitoring with model features
  and model pricing to optimize model usage. You can also use this monitoring to optimize
  prompt sizes.
