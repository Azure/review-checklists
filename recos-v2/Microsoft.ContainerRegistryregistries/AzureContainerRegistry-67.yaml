title: Disable anonymous pull access
description: By default, Azure container registry requires authentication for pull/push
  actions. Enabling anonymous pull access exposes all content for public read actions.
  This applies to all repositories, potentially allowing unrestricted access if repository-scoped
  tokens are used.
