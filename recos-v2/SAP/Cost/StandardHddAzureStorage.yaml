title: In the case of using Azure Premium Storage with SAP HANA, Azure Standard SSD
  storage can be used to select a cost-conscious storage solution. However, please
  note that choosing Standard SSD or Standard HDD Azure storage will affect the SLA
  of the individual VMs. Also, for systems with lower I/O throughput and low latency,
  such as non-production environments, lower series VMs can be used.
