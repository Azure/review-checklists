title: When you create availability sets, use the maximum number of fault domains
  and update domains available. For example, if you deploy more than two VMs in one
  availability set, use the maximum number of fault domains (three) and enough update
  domains to limit the effect of potential physical hardware failures, network outages,
  or power interruptions, in addition to Azure planned maintenance. The default number
  of fault domains is two, and you can't change it online later.
