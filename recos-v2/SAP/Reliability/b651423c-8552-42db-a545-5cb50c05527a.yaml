text: You can replicate standard storage between paired regions, but you can't use
  standard storage to store your databases or virtual hard disks. You can replicate
  backups only between paired regions that you use. For all your other data, run your
  replication by using native DBMS features like SQL Server Always On or SAP HANA
  System Replication. Use a combination of Site Recovery, rsync or robocopy, and other
  third-party software for the SAP application layer.
