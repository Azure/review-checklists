title: If you deploy Azure NetApp Files for your HANA, Oracle, or DB2 database, use
  the Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool (AzAcSnap) to take application-consistent
  snapshots. AzAcSnap also supports Oracle databases. Consider using AzAcSnap on a
  central VM rather than on individual VMs.
