title: If the virtual machine's DNS or virtual name is not changed during migration
  to Azure, Background DNS and virtual names connect many system interfaces in the
  SAP landscape, and customers are only sometimes aware of the interfaces that developers
  define over time. Connection challenges arise between various systems when virtual
  or DNS names change after migrations, and it's recommended to retain DNS aliases
  to prevent these types of difficulties.
