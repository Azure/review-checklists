text: Virtual WAN manages connectivity between spoke VNets for virtual-WAN-based topologies
  (no need to set up user-defined routing [UDR] or NVAs), and maximum network throughput
  for VNet-to-VNet traffic in the same virtual hub is 50 gigabits per second. If necessary,
  SAP landing zones can use VNet peering to connect to other landing zones and overcome
  this bandwidth limitation.
