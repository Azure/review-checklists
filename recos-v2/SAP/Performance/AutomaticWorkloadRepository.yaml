title: For SAP on Azure running Oracle, a collection of SQL scripts can help you diagnose
  performance problems.  Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reports contain valuable
  information for diagnosing problems in the Oracle system. We recommend that you
  run an AWR report during several sessions and choose peak times for it, to ensure
  broad coverage for the analysis.
