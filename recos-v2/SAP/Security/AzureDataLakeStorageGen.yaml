title: To prevent data leakage, use Azure Private Link to securely access platform
  as a service resources like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Data Lake Storage
  Gen2, Azure Data Factory, and more. Azure Private Endpoint can also help to secure
  traffic between VNets and services like Azure Storage, Azure Backup, and more. Traffic
  between your VNet and the Private Endpoint enabled service travels across the Microsoft
  global network, which prevents its exposure to the public internet.
