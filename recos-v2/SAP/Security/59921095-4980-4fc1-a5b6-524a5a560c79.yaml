title: If you're using SAP BTP services or SaaS solutions that require SAP Identity
  Authentication Service (IAS), consider implementing SSO between SAP Cloud Identity
  Authentication Services and Azure AD to access those SAP services. This integration
  lets SAP IAS act as a proxy identity provider and forwards authentication requests
  to Azure AD as the central user store and identity provider.
