title: 'Enable WAF rule sets that detect and block potentially malicious traffic.
  This feature is available on the Premium tier. We recommend these rule sets:  -
  Default- Bot protection- IP restriction- Geo-filtering- Rate limiting'
description: Default rule sets are updated frequently based on OWASP top-10 attack
  types and information from Microsoft Threat Intelligence.  The specialized rule
  sets detect certain use cases. For example, bot rules classify bots as good, bad,
  or unknown based on the client IP addresses. They also block bad bots and known
  IP addresses and restrict traffic based on geographical location of the callers.  By
  using a combination of rule sets, you can detect and block attacks with various
  intents.
