title: Protect Azure Front Door against unexpected traffic. Azure Front Door uses
  the basic plan of Azure DDoS protection to protect application endpoints from DDoS
  attacks. If you need to expose other public IP addresses from your application,
  consider adding the DDoS Protection standard plan for those addresses for advanced
  protection and detection capabilities.
