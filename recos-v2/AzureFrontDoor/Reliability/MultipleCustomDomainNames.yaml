title: Use the same host name on Azure Front Door and your origin. Azure Front Door
  can rewrite the host header of incoming requests, which is useful when you have
  multiple custom domain names that route to one origin. However, rewriting the host
  header might cause issues with request cookies and URL redirection.
description: Set the same host name to prevent malfunction with session affinity,
  authentication, and authorization. For more information, see Preserve the original
  HTTP host name between a reverse proxy and its back-end web application.
