title: Set a timeout on forwarding requests to the back end.  Adjust the timeout setting
  according to your endpoints' needs. If you don't, Azure Front Door might close the
  connection before the origin sends the response.  You can also lower the default
  timeout for Azure Front Door if all of your origins have a shorter timeout.  For
  more information, see Troubleshooting unresponsive requests.
description: Timeouts help prevent performance issues and availability issues by terminating
  requests that take longer than expected to complete.
