description: ExpressRoute dedicated circuits guarantee `99.95%` availability when
  an active-active connectivity is configured between on-premises and Azure. This
  mode provides higher availability of your Expressroute connection. It's also recommended
  to configure BFD for faster failover if there's a link failure on a connection.
