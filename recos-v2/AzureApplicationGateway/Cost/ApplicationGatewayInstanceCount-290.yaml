name: ApplicationGatewayInstanceCount-290
title: Have a scale-in and scale-out policy
description: A scale-out policy ensures that there will be enough instances to handle
  incoming traffic and spikes. Also, have a scale-in policy that makes sure the number
  of instances are reduced when demand drops. Consider the choice of instance size.
  The size can significantly impact the cost. Some considerations are described in
  the Estimate the Application Gateway instance count.For more information, see What
  is Azure Application Gateway v2?
