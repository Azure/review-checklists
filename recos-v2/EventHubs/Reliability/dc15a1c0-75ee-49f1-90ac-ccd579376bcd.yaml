description: The built-in geo-disaster recovery feature, when enabled, ensures that
  the entire configuration of anamespace (Event Hubs, Consumer Groups and settings)
  is continuously replicated from a primary namespace to a secondary namespace, and
  it allows a once-only failover move from the primary to the secondary at any time.
  Active/Passive feature is designed to make it easier to recover from and abandon
  a failed Azure region without having to change application configurations
