title: When possible, your application should be using a managed identity to authenticate
  to Azure Event Hub. If not, consider having the storage credential (SAS, service
  principal credential) in Azure Key Vault or an equivalent service
description: 'Managed identities for Azure resources can authorize access to Event
  Hubs resources using Azure AD credentials from applications running in Azure Virtual
  Machines (VMs), Function apps, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and other services. By
  using managed identities for Azure resources together with Azure AD authentication,
  you can avoid storing credentials with your applications that run in the cloud. '
