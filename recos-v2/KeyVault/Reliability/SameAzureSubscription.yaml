title: When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate,
  the backup operation will download the object as an encrypted blob. This blob can't
  be decrypted outside of Azure. To get usable data from this blob, you must restore
  the blob into a key vault within the same Azure subscription and Azure geography.
  Familiarize yourself with the Key Vault's backup and restore guidance.
