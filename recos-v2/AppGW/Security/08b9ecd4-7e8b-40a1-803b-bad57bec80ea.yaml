description: A TLS certificate of the backend server must be issued by a well-known
  CA. If the certificate was not issued by a trusted CA, the Application Gateway checks
  if the certificate was issued by a trusted CA, and so on, until a trusted CA certificate
  is found. Only then a secure connection is established. Otherwise, Application Gateway
  marks the backend as unhealthy.
