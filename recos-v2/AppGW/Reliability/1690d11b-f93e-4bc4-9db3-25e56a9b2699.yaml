description: The health probe sends requests to the configured endpoint at a set interval.
  Also, there's a threshold of failed requests that will be tolerated before the backend
  is marked unhealthy. These numbers present a trade-off.- Setting a higher interval
  puts a higher load on your service. Each Application Gateway instance sends its
  own health probes, so 100 instances every 30 seconds means 100 requests per 30 seconds.-
  Setting a lower interval leaves more time before an outage is detected.- Setting
  a low unhealthy threshold might mean that short, transient failures might take down
  a backend. - Setting a high threshold it can take longer to take a backend out of
  rotation.
