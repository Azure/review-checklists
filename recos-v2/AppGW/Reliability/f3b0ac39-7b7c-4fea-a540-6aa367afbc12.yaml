description: Certain scenarios can force you to implement rules specifically on Application
  Gateway. For example, if ModSec CRS 2.2.9, CRS 3.0 or CRS 3.1 rules are required,
  these rules can be only implemented on Application Gateway. Conversely, rate-limiting
  and geo-filtering are available only on Azure Front Door, not on AppGateway.
