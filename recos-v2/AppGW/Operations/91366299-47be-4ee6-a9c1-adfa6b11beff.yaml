description: Application Gateway checks for the renewed certificate version in the
  linked Key Vault at every 4-hour interval. If it is inaccessible due to any incorrect
  Key Vault configuration, it logs that error and pushes a corresponding Advisor recommendation.
  You must configure the Advisor alerts to stay updated and fix such issues immediately
  to avoid any Control or Data plane related problems. For more information, see Investigating
  and resolving key vault errors. To set an alert for this specific case, use the
  Recommendation Type as Resolve Azure Key Vault issue for your Application Gateway.
