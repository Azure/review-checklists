description: We recommend 125 as the maximum autoscale instance count. Make sure the
  subnet that has the Application Gateway has sufficient available IP addresses to
  support the scale-up set of instances.Setting the maximum instance count to 125
  has no cost implications because you're billed only for the consumed capacity.
