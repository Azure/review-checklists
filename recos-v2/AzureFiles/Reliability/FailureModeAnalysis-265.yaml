title: 'Define reliability and recovery targets: Review the Azure service-level agreements
  (SLAs). Derive the service-level objective (SLO) for the storage account. For example,
  the redundancy configuration that you chose might affect the SLO. Consider the effect
  of a regional outage, the potential for data loss, and the time required to restore
  access after an outage. Also consider the availability of internal dependencies
  that you identified as part of your failure mode analysis.'
