title: 'Use failure mode analysis: Minimize points of failure by considering internal
  dependencies such as the availability of virtual networks, Azure Key Vault, or Azure
  Content Delivery Network or Azure Front Door endpoints. Failures can occur if you
  need credentials to access Azure Files, and the credentials go missing from Key
  Vault. Or you might have a failure if your workloads use an endpoint that''s based
  on a missing content delivery network. In these cases, you might need to configure
  your workloads to connect to an alternative endpoint. For general information about
  failure mode analysis, see Recommendations for performing failure mode analysis.'
