title: "Configure your storage account for redundancy. For maximum availability and\
  \ durability, configure your account with\u202Fzone-redundant storage (ZRS), GRS,\
  \ or\u202FGZRS. Limited Azure regions support ZRS for standard and premium file\
  \ shares. Only standard SMB accounts support GRS and GZRS. Premium SMB shares and\
  \ NFS shares don't support GRS and GZRS. Azure Files doesn't support read-access\
  \ geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).\
  \ If you configure a storage account to use RA-GRS or RA-GZRS, the file shares are\
  \ configured and billed as GRS or GZRS."
description: Redundancy protects your data against unexpected failures. The ZRS and
  GZRS configuration options replicate across various availability zones and enable
  applications to continue reading data during an outage. For more information, see
  Durability and availability by outage scenario and Durability and availability parameters.
