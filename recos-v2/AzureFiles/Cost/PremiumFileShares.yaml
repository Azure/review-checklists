name: PremiumFileShares
title: If you use premium shares, ensure that you provision more than enough capacity
  and performance for your workload but not so much that you incur unnecessary costs.
  We recommend overprovisioning by two to three times. You can dynamically scale premium
  file shares up or down depending on your storage and input/output (IO) performance
  characteristics.
description: Overprovision premium file shares by a reasonable amount to help maintain
  performance and account for future growth and performance requirements.
