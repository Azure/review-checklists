title: Use Azure Files reservations, also referred to as reserved instances, to precommit
  to storage usage and get a discount. Use reservations for production workloads or
  dev/test workloads with consistent footprints. For more information, see Optimize
  costs with storage reservations. Reservations don't include transaction, bandwidth,
  data transfer, and metadata storage charges.
description: Three-year reservations can provide a discount up to 36% on the total
  cost of file storage. Reservations don't affect performance.
