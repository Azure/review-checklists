title: When you migrate to standard Azure file shares, we recommend that you start
  in the transaction-optimized tier during the initial migration. Transaction usage
  during migration isn't typically indicative of normal transaction usage. This consideration
  doesn't apply for premium file shares because the provisioned billing model doesn't
  charge for transactions.
description: Migrating to Azure Files is a temporary, transaction-heavy workload.
  Optimize the price for high-transaction workloads to help reduce migration costs.
