title: Use only the most recent supported SMB protocol version (currently 3.1.1.),
  and use only AES-256-GCM for SMB channel encryption. Azure Files exposes settings
  that you can use to toggle the SMB protocol and make it more compatible or more
  secure, depending on your organization's requirements. By default, all SMB versions
  are allowed. However, SMB 2.1 is disallowed if you enable Require secure transfer
  because SMB 2.1 doesn't support encryption of data in transit. If you restrict these
  settings to a high level of security, some clients might not be able to connect
  to the file share.
description: SMB 3.1.1, released with Windows 10, contains important security and
  performance updates. AES-256-GCM offers more secure channel encryption.
