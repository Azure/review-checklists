title: 'Consider using network controls to restrict ingress and egress traffic: You
  might be comfortable exposing your storage account to the public internet under
  certain conditions, like if you use identity-based authentication to grant access
  to file shares. But we recommend that you use network controls to grant the minimum
  required level of access to users and applications. For more information, see How
  to approach network security for your storage account.'
