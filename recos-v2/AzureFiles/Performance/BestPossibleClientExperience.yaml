title: Make sure your file share or storage account isn't being throttled, which can
  result in high latency, low throughput, or low IOPS. Requests are throttled when
  the IOPS, ingress, or egress limits are reached. For standard storage accounts,
  throttling occurs at the account level. For premium file shares, throttling usually
  occurs at the share level.
description: Avoid throttling to provide the best possible client experience.
