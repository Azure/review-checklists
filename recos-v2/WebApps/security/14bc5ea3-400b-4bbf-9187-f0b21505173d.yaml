description: The application retrieves secrets from Key Vault to authenticate outward
  communication from the application. Azure manages the identity and doesn't require
  you to provision or rotate any secrets.  You have distinct identities for granularity
  of control. Distinct identities make revocation easy if an identity is compromised.
