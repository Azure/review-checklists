title: 'Protect application secrets: You need to handle sensitive information, like
  API keys or authentication tokens. Instead of hardcoding these secrets directly
  into your application code or configuration files, you can use Azure Key Vault references
  in app settings. When the application starts, App Service automatically retrieves
  the secret values from Key Vault by using the app''s managed identity.'
