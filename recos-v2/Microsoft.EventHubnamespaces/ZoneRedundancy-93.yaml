title: Ensure zone redundancy is enabled in supported regions
description: When using the Azure portal, zone redundancy is automatically enabled.
  However, some Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools may default this to false. To ensure
  replication of metadata and events across data centers in an availability zone,
  always verify that zone redundancy is enabled.
