title: 'SFTP: Limit the amount of ''local users'' for SFTP access, and audit whether
  access is needed over time.'
description: When accessing blob storage via SFTP using a 'local user account', the
  'usual' RBAC controls do not apply. Blob access via NFS or REST might be more restrictive
  than SFTP access. Unfortunately, as of early 2023, local users are the only form
  of identity management that is currently supported for the SFTP endpoint
