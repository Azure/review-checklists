description: 'Storage account keys (''shared keys'') have very little audit capabilities.
  While it can be monitored on who/when fetched a copy of the keys, once the keys
  are in the hands of multiple people, it is impossible to attribute usage to a specific
  user. Solely relying on AAD authentication makes it easier to tie storage access
  to a user. '
