description: Consider 'legal hold' or 'time-based retention' policies for blobs, so
  that is is impossible to delete the blob, the container, or the storage account.
  Please note that 'impossible' actually means 'impossible'; once a storage account
  contains an immutable blob, the only way to 'get rid' of that storage account is
  by cancelling the Azure subscription.
