name: Low-LatencyDiskSupportVms
title: (VMs, scale set)  Set the storage profile by analyzing the disk performance
  of existing workloads and the VM SKU.  Use Premium SSDs for production VMs. Adjust
  the performance of disks with Premium SSD v2. Use locally attached NVMe devices.
description: Premium SSDs deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support VMs
  with I/O-intensive workloads.  Premium SSD v2 doesn't require disk resizing, which
  enables high performance without excessive over-provisioning and minimizes the cost
  of unused capacity.  When available on VM SKUs, locally attached NVMe or similar
  devices can offer high performance, especially for use cases that require high input/output
  operations per second (IOPS) and low latency.
