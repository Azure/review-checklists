title: (Scale set) Keep your VMs up to date by setting an upgrade policy. We recommend
  rolling upgrades. However, if you need granular control, choose to upgrade manually.  For
  Flexible orchestration, you can use  Azure Update Manager.
description: Security is the primary reason for upgrades. Security assurances for
  the instances shouldn't decay over time.  Rolling upgrades are done in batches,
  which ensures all instances aren't down at the same time.
