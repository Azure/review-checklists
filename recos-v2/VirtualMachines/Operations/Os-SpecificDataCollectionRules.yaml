title: (VMs, scale set) Monitor and measure the health of the VM instances.  Deploy
  the Monitor agent extension to your VMs to collect monitoring data from the guest
  OS with OS-specific data collection rules.  Enable VM insights to monitor health
  and performance and to view trends from the collected data. Use boot diagnostics
  to get information as VMs boot. Boot diagnostics also diagnose boot failures.
description: Monitoring data is at the core of incident resolution. A comprehensive
  monitoring stack provides information about how the VMs are performing and their
  health. By continuously monitoring the instances, you can be ready for or prevent
  failures like performance overload and reliability issues.
