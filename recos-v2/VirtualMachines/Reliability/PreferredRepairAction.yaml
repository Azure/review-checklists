title: (VMs) Implement heath endpoints that emit instance health statuses on VMs.  (Scale
  set) Enable automatic repairs on the scale set by specifying the preferred repair
  action.  Consider setting a time frame during which automatic repairs pause if the
  VM's state changes.
description: Maintain availability even if an instance is deemed unhealthy. Automatic
  repairs initiate recovery by replacing the faulty instance. Setting a time window
  can prevent inadvertent or premature repair operations.
