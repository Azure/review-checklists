title: (VMs, scale set) Evaluate the disk options that are associated with your VM's
  SKUs.  Determine your performance needs while keeping in mind your storage capacity
  needs and accounting for fluctuating workload patterns.  For example, the Azure
  Premium SSD v2 disk allows you to granularly adjust your performance independent
  of the disk's size.
description: Some high-performance disk types offer extra cost optimization features
  and strategies.  The Premium SSD v2 disk's adjustment capability can reduce costs
  because it provides high performance without overprovisioning, which could otherwise
  lead to underutilized resources.
