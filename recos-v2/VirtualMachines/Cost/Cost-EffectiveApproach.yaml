name: Cost-EffectiveApproach
title: Look for ways to optimize. Some strategies include choosing the most cost-effective
  approach between increasing resources in an existing system, or scaling up, and
  adding more instances of that system, or scaling out. You can offload demand by
  distributing it to other resources, or you can reduce demand by implementing priority
  queues, gateway offloading, buffering, and rate limiting. For more information,
  see the recommendations in Performance Efficiency.
