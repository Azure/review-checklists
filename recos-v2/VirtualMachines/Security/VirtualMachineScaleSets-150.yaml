title: (VMs, scale set) Set a security profile with the security features that you
  want to enable in the VM configuration.  For example, when you specify encryption
  at host in the profile, the data that's stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest
  and flows are encrypted to the storage service.
description: The features in the security profile are automatically enabled when the
  VM is created.  For more information, see Azure security baseline for Virtual Machine
  Scale Sets.
