title: Apply access controls to the identities that try to reach the VMs and also
  to the VMs that reach other resources. Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication
  and authorization needs. Put strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and role-based
  access control (RBAC) in place for your VMs and their dependencies, like secrets,
  to permit allowed identities to perform only the operations that are expected of
  their roles.
