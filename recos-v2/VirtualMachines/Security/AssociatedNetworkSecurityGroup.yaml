title: (VMs) Choose secure networking options for your VM's network profile.  Don't
  directly associate public IP addresses to your VMs and don't enable IP forwarding.  Ensure
  that all virtual network interfaces have an associated network security group.
description: You can set segmentation controls in the networking profile.  Attackers
  scan public IP addresses, which makes VMs vulnerable to threats.
