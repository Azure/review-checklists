title: Use multiple DNS servers per private FQDN zone
description: Azure VMware Solution private clouds support up to three DNS servers
  for a single FQDN, preventing a single DNS server from becoming a point of failure.
  It's crucial to use multiple DNS servers for on-premises FQDN resolution from each
  private cloud.
