title: Make VMs and their dependencies redundant across zones. If a VM fails, the
  workload should continue to function because of redundancy. Include dependencies
  in your redundancy choices. For example, use the built-in redundancy options that
  are available with disks. Use zone-redundant IPs to ensure data availability and
  high uptime.
