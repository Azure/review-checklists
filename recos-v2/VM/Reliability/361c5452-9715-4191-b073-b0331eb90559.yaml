title: Review Virtual Machines quotas and limits that might pose design restrictions.
  VMs have specific limits and quotas, which vary based on the type of VM or the region.
  There might be subscription restrictions, such as the number of VMs per subscription
  or the number of cores per VM. If other workloads share your subscription, then
  your ability to consume data might be reduced.
