title: Conduct a failure mode analysis to minimize points of failure by analyzing
  VM interactions with the network and storage components. Choose configurations like
  ephemeral operating system (OS) disks to localize disk access and avoid network
  hops. Add a load balancer to enhance self-preservation by distributing network traffic
  across multiple VMs, which improves availability and reliability.
