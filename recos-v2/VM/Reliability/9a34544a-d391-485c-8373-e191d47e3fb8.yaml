title: Explore the automatic recovery options. Azure supports health degradation monitoring
  and self-healing features for VMs. For example, scale sets provide automatic instance
  repairs. In more advanced scenarios, self-healing involves using Azure Site Recovery,
  having a passive standby to fail over to, or redeploying from infrastructure as
  code (IaC). The method that you choose should align with the business requirements
  and your organizational operations. For more information, see VM service disruptions.
