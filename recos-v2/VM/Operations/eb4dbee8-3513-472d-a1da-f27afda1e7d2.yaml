title: (VMs, scale set) Monitor and measure the health of the VM instances.  Deploy
  the Monitor agent extension to your VMs to collect monitoring data from the guest
  OS with OS-specific data collection rules.  Enable VM insights to monitor health
  and performance and to view trends from the collected data. Use boot diagnostics
  to get information as VMs boot. Boot diagnostics also diagnose boot failures.
