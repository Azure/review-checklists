title: When possible, your application should be using a managed identity to authenticate
  to Azure Service Bus. If not, consider having the storage credential (SAS, service
  principal credential) in Azure Key Vault or an equivalent service
description: 'A Service Bus client app running inside an Azure App Service application
  or in a virtual machine with enabled managed entities for Azure resources support
  does not need to handle SAS rules and keys, or any other access tokens. The client
  app only needs the endpoint address of the Service Bus Messaging namespace. '
