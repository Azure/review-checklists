description: Communication between a client application and an Azure Service Bus namespace
  is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Azure Service Bus namespaces
  permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter
  security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that
  clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS.
