title: 'Take advantage of model catalogs and registries: Take advantage of Machine
  Learning model catalogs and registries to store, version, and share machine learning
  assets.Use Machine Learning model catalogs to help you implement A/B testing and
  deployment of models.'
description: Use Machine Learning model registries to store and version your machine
  learning models to track changes and maintain lineage with the job and datasets
  used for training. With Machine Learning model catalogs, your data science teams
  can discover, evaluate, and fine tune pretrained foundational machine learning models.
  Storing versioned models in Machine Learning model registries supports deployment
  strategies such as A/B releases, canary releases, and rollbacks.
