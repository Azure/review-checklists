title: 'Monitor infrastructure: Monitor online endpoints and integrate with Monitor
  to track and monitor the appropriate metrics and logs. Enable Application Insights
  when creating online deployments.Monitor training infrastructure and review resource
  usage such as memory and CPU or GPU usage when training models to ensure you''re
  meeting your baseline requirements.'
description: Monitoring endpoints gives you visibility into metrics such as request
  latency and requests per minute. You can compare your performance versus your baseline
  and use this information to make changes to compute resources accordingly. Monitoring
  metrics such as network bytes can alert you if you're approaching quota limits and
  prevent throttling.Likewise, monitoring your training environment provides you with
  the information to make changes to your training environment. Use that information
  to decide to scale in or out, scale up or down with different performant SKUs, or
  choose between CPUs or GPUs.
