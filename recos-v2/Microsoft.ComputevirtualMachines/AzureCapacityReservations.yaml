title: Reserve Compute Capacity for critical workloads
description: Azure Capacity Reservations ensure high availability for virtual machines
  by reserving compute capacity in advance within a specific region or availability
  zone. This guarantees that VMs will have the necessary resources during peak demand
  or maintenance events, enhancing reliability and uptime.
