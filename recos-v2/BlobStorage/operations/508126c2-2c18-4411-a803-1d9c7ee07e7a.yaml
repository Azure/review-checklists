title: 'Set up policies that delete blobs or move them to cost-efficient access tiers:
  Create a lifecycle management policy with an initial set of conditions. Policy runs
  automatically delete or set the access tier of blobs based on the conditions you
  define. Periodically analyze container use by using Monitor metrics and blob inventory
  reports so that you can refine conditions to optimize cost efficiency.'
