title: 'Choose the most cost-effective default access tier: Unless a tier is specified
  with each blob upload, blobs infer their access tier from the default access tier
  setting. A change to the default access tier setting of a storage account applies
  to all blobs in the account for which an access tier hasn''t been explicitly set.
  This cost could be significant if you''ve collected a large number of blobs. For
  more information about how a tier change affects each existing blob, see Changing
  a blob''s access tier.'
