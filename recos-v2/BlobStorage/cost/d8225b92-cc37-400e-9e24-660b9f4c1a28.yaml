title: 'Upload data directly to the most cost-efficient access tier: For example,
  if the default access tier setting of your account is hot, but you''re uploading
  files for archiving purposes, specify a cooler tier as the archive or a cold tier
  as part of your upload operation. After uploading blobs, use lifecycle management
  policies to move blobs to the most cost-efficient tiers based on usage metrics such
  as the last accessed time. Choosing the most optimal tier up front can reduce costs.
  If you change the tier of a block blob that you already uploaded, then you pay the
  cost of writing to the initial tier when you first upload the blob, and then pay
  the cost of writing to the desired tier.'
