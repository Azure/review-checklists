description: Storing resource logs in a storage account for later analysis can be
  a cheaper option. Using lifecycle management policies to manage log retention in
  a storage account prevents large numbers of logs files building up over time, which
  can lead to unnecessary capacity charges.

title: Reduce the cost of using resource logs by choosing the appropriate log storage
  location and by managing log-retention periods. If you only plan to query logs occasionally
  (for example, querying logs for compliance auditing), consider sending resource
  logs to a storage account instead of sending them to an Azure Monitor Logs workspace.
  You can use a serverless query solution such as Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze
  logs. For more information, see Optimize cost for infrequent queries. Use lifecycle
  management policies to delete or archive logs.
