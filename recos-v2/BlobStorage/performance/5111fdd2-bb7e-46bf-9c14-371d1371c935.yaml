title: Add a hash character sequence (such as three digits) as early as possible in
  the partition key of a blob. The partition key is the account name, container name,
  virtual directory name, and blob name. If you plan to use timestamps in names, then
  consider adding a seconds value to the beginning of that stamp. For more information,
  see Partitioning.
