title: 'Reduce travel distance between the client and server: Place data in regions
  nearest to connecting clients (ideally in the same region). Optimize for clients
  in regions far away by using object replication or a content delivery network. Default
  network configurations provide the best performance. Modify network settings only
  to improve security. In general, network settings don''t decrease travel distance
  and don''t improve performance.'
