title: 'Optimize the performance of custom code: Consider using Storage SDKs instead
  of creating your own wrappers for blob REST operations. Azure SDKs are optimized
  for performance and provide mechanisms to fine-tune performance. Before creating
  an application, review the performance and scalability checklist for Blob Storage.
  Consider using query acceleration to filter out unwanted data during the storage
  request and keep clients from needlessly transferring data across the network.'
