title: 'Optimize environment costs: Consider the Basic or Free tier to run pre-production
  environments. These tiers are low performance and low cost. If you use the Basic
  or Free tier, use governance to enforce the tier, constrain the number of instances
  and CPUs, restrict scaling, and limit log retention.'
