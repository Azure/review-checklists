title: 'Use caching: Retrieving information from a resource that doesn''t change frequently
  and is expensive to access affects performance. Complex queries, including joins
  and multiple lookups, contribute to runtime. Perform caching to minimize the processing
  time and latency. Cache query results to avoid repeated round trips to the database
  or back end and reduce processing time for subsequent requests.'
