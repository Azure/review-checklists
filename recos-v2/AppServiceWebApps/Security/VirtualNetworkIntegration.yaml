title: (App Service) Configure the application for virtual network integration.  Use
  private endpoints for App Service apps. Block all public traffic.  Route the container
  image pull through the virtual network integration. All outgoing traffic from the
  application passes through the virtual network.
description: Get the security benefits of using an Azure virtual network. For example,
  the application can securely access resources within the network.   Add a private
  endpoint to help protect your application. Private endpoints limit direct exposure
  to the public network and allow controlled access through the reverse proxy.
