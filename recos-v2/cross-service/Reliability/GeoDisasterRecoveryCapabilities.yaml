title: Consider a multi-region deployment. Depending on customer size, locations,
  and users presence, operating in multiple regions can be a common choice to deliver
  services and run applications closer to them. Using a multi-region deployment is
  also important to provide geo disaster recovery capabilities, to eliminate the dependency
  from a single region capacity and diminish the risk of a temporary and localized
  resource capacity constraint
