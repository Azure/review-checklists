title: Key vaults should have soft delete enabled
description: Key Vault's soft-delete feature enables recovery of deleted vaults and
  objects like keys, secrets, and certificates. When enabled, marked resources are
  retained for 90 days, allowing for their recovery, essentially undoing deletion.
