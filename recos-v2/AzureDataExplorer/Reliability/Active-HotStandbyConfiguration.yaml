title: For applications, which required only read during failure, create Active-Hot
  standby configuration
description: The Active-Hot configuration is similar to the Active-Active configuration
  in dual ingest, processing, and curation. While the standby cluster is online for
  ingestion, process, and curation, it isn't available to query. The standby cluster
  doesn't need to be in the same SKU as the primary cluster. It can be of a smaller
  SKU and scale, which may result in it being less performant. In a disaster scenario,
  users are redirected to the standby cluster, which can optionally be scaled up to
  increase performance.
