title: To protect against regional failure, create Multiple independent clusters,
  preferably in two Azure Paired regions
description: Azure Data Explorer doesn't support automatic protection against the
  outage of an entire Azure region. This disruption can happen during a natural disaster,
  like an earthquake. If you require a solution for a disaster recovery situation,
  do the following steps to ensure business continuity. In these steps, you'll replicate
  your clusters, management, and data ingestion in two Azure paired regions.
