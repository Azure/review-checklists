title: To share data, explore Leader-follower cluster configuration
description: Azure Data Explorer provides an optional follower capability for a leader
  cluster to be followed by other follower clusters for read-only access to the leader's
  data and metadata. Changes in the leader, such as create, append, and drop are automatically
  synchronized to the follower. While the leaders could span Azure regions, the follower
  clusters should be hosted in the same region(s) as the leader. If the leader cluster
  is down or databases or tables are accidentally dropped, the follower clusters will
  lose access until access is recovered in the leader.
