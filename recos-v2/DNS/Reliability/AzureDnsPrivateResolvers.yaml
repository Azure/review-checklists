title: Implement DNS Failover using Azure DNS Private Resolvers
description: To eliminate a single point of failure in your on-premises DNS services
  and ensure reliable DNS resolution during business continuity and disaster recovery
  scenarios, it is recommended to utilize Azure DNS Private Resolvers in multiple
  regions. By deploying two or more Azure DNS private resolvers across different regions,
  you can enable DNS failover and achieve resiliency in your DNS infrastructure.
