title: Configure data persistence for an Azure Cache for Redis instance. Because your
  cache data is stored in memory, a rare and unplanned failure of multiple nodes can
  cause all the data to be dropped. To avoid losing data completely, Redis persistence
  allows you to take periodic snapshots of in-memory data, and store it to your storage
  account.
