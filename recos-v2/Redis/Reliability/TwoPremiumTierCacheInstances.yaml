title: Configure passive geo-replication for Premium Azure Cache for Redis instances.
  Geo-replication is a mechanism for linking two or more Azure Cache for Redis instances,
  typically spanning two Azure regions. Geo-replication is designed mainly for cross-region
  disaster recovery. Two Premium tier cache instances are connected through geo-replication
  in a way that provides reads and writes to your primary cache, and that data is
  replicated to the secondary cache.
