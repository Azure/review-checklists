  to overlay a central base policy. Allow for granular policies to meet the requirements
  of specific regions. Each policy can contains different sets of DNAT, Network and
  Application rules with specific priority, action and processing order. Create your
  rules based on least privilege access Zero Trust principle . How rules are processed
  is explained in this article.
