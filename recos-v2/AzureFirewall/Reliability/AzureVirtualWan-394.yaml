description: For traditional Hub & Spokes architectures, multi-region details are
  explained in this article. For secured virtual hubs (Azure Virtual WAN), Routing
  Intent and Policies must be configured to secure inter-hub and branch-to-branch
  communications. For workloads designed to be resistant to failures and fault tolerant,

  as regional resources.
