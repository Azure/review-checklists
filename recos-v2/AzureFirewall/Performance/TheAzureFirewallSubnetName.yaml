title: Configure an Azure Firewall subnet (AzureFirewallSubnet) with a /26 address
  space.
description: Azure Firewall is a dedicated deployment in your virtual network. Within
  your virtual network, a dedicated subnet is required for the instance of Azure Firewall.
  Azure Firewall provisions more capacity as it scales.A /26 address space for its
  subnets ensures that the firewall has enough IP addresses available to accommodate
  the scaling. Azure Firewall doesn't need a subnet bigger than /26. The Azure Firewall
  subnet name must be AzureFirewallSubnet.
