title: Connect ExpressRoute gateway with circuits from diverse peering locations for
  resilience
description: |-
  To increase reliability, it's advised that each ExpressRoute gateway connects to at least two circuits, with each circuit originating from a different peering location than the other, ensuring diverse connectivity paths for enhanced resilience.
