title: Enable Service managed failover
description: Maintain business continuity during regional outages. Azure Cosmos DB
  supports service-managed failover during a regional outage. During a regional outage,
  Azure Cosmos DB continues to maintain its latency, availability, consistency, and
  throughput SLAs. To help make sure that your entire application is highly available,
  Azure Cosmos DB offers a manual failover API to simulate a regional outage. By using
  this API, you can carry out regular business continuity drills.
