title: 'Decide whether your workload requires the performance of premium file shares
  (Azure Premium SSD) or if Azure Standard HDD storage is sufficient: Determine your
  storage account type and billing model based on the type of storage that you need.
  If you require large amounts of input/output operations per second (IOPS), extremely
  fast data transfer speeds, or very low latency, then you should choose premium Azure
  file shares. NFS Azure file shares are only available on the premium tier. NFS and
  SMB file shares are the same price on the premium tier.'
