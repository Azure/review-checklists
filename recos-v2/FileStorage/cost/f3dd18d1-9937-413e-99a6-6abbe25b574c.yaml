title: 'Choose the most cost-effective access tier: Standard SMB Azure file shares
  offer three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. All three tiers
  are stored on the same standard storage hardware. The main difference for these
  three tiers is their data at rest storage prices, which are lower in cooler tiers,
  and the transaction prices, which are higher in cooler tiers. For more information,
  see Differences in standard tiers.'
