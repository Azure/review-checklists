title: 'Understand your application and usage patterns to achieve predictable performance:
  Determine latency sensitivity, IOPS and throughput requirements, workload duration
  and frequency, and workload parallelization. Use Azure Files for multi-threaded
  applications to help you achieve the upper performance limits of a service. If most
  of your requests are metadata-centric, such as createfile, openfile, closefile,
  queryinfo, or querydirectory, the requests create poor latency that''s higher than
  the read and write operations. If you have this problem, consider separating the
  file share into multiple file shares within the same storage account.'
