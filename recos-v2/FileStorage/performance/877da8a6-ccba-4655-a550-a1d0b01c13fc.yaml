title: Enable SMB Multichannel for premium SMB file shares. SMB Multichannel allows
  an SMB 3.1.1 client to establish multiple network connections to an SMB Azure file
  share. SMB Multichannel only works when the feature is enabled on both client-side
  (your client) and service-side (Azure). On Windows clients, SMB Multichannel is
  enabled by default, but you need to enable it on your storage account.
