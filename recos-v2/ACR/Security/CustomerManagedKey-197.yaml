title: Encrypt registry with a customer managed key
description: Azure Container Registry automatically encrypts images and other artifacts
  that you store. By default, Azure automatically encrypts the registry content at
  rest by using service-managed keys. By using a customer-managed key, you can supplement
  default encryption with an additional encryption layer.
