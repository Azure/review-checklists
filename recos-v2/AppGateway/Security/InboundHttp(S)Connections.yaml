title: Deploy Azure Application Gateway v2 or partner NVAs used for proxying inbound
  HTTP(S) connections within the landing-zone virtual network and with the apps that
  they're securing.
description: Administration of reverse proxies in general and WAF in particular is
  closer to the application than to networking, so they belong in the same subscription
  as the app. Centralizing the Application Gateway and WAF in the connectivity subscription
  might be OK if it is managed by one single team.
