description: Azure Firewall has the ability to comprehensively log metadata of all
  traffic it sees, to Log Analytics Workspaces, Storage or third party solutions through
  Event Hubs. However, all logging solutions incur costs for data processing and storage.
  At very large volumes these costs can be significant, a cost effective approach
  and alternative to Log Analytics should be considered and cost estimated. Consider
  whether it is required to log traffic metadata for all logging categories and modify
  in Diagnostic Settings if needed.
