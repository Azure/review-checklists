description: When you deploy a new Azure Firewall instance, if you enable the forced
  tunneling mode, you can set the public IP address to None to deploy a fully private
  data plane. However, the management plane still requires a public IP for management
  purposes only. The internal traffic from virtual and on-premises networks won't
  use that public IP. For more about forced tunneling, see Azure Firewall forced tunneling.
