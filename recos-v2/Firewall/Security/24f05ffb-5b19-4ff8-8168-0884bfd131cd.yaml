description: With explicit proxy feature enabled on the outbound path, you can configure
  a proxy setting on the sending web application (such as a web browser) with Azure
  Firewall configured as the proxy. As a result, web traffic will reach the firewall's
  private IP address and therefore egresses directly from the firewall without using
  a UDR. This feature also facilitates the usage of multiple firewalls without modifying
  existing network routes.
