description: Azure Firewall Policies can be arranged in an hierarchical structure
  to overlay a central base policy. Allow for granular policies to meet the requirements
  of specific regions. Delegate incremental firewall policies to local security teams
  through role-based access control (RBAC). Some settings are specific per instance,
  for example DNAT Rules and DNS configuration, then multiple specialized policies
  might be required.
