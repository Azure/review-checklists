title: Automatic Job Termination is enabled, ensure there are no user-defined local
  processes
description: To conserve cluster resources, you can terminate a cluster to store its
  configuration for future reuse or autostart jobs. Clusters can auto-terminate after
  inactivity, but this only tracks Spark jobs, not local processes, which might still
  be running even after Spark jobs end.
