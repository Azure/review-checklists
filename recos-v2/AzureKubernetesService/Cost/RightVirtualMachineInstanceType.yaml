title: 'Cluster architecture: Select the right virtual machine instance type.'
description: Selecting the right virtual machine instance type is critical as it directly
  impacts the cost of running applications on AKS. Choosing a high-performance instance
  without proper utilization can lead to wasteful spending, while choosing a powerful
  instance can lead to performance issues and increased downtime. To determine the
  right virtual machine instance type, consider workload characteristics, resource
  requirements, and availability needs.
