title: Enable versioning for accidental modification and keep the number of versions
  below 1000
description: Consider enabling versioning for Azure Storage Accounts to recover from
  accidental modifications or deletions and manage blob operation latency. Microsoft
  advises maintaining fewer than 1000 versions per blob to optimize performance. Lifecycle
  management can help delete old versions automatically.
