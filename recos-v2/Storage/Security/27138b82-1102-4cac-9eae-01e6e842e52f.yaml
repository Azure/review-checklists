description: Use near-term expiration times on an ad hoc SAS service SAS or account
  SAS. In this way, even if a SAS is compromised, it's valid only for a short time.
  This practice is especially important if you cannot reference a stored access policy.
  Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to
  a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it.
