description: Use Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS) in the primary region for scenarios
  that require high availability and for restricting replication to a particular country
  or region. For protection against regional disasters, use Geo-zone-redundant Storage
  (GZRS), which combines ZRS in the primary region with geo-replication to a secondary
  region?.
