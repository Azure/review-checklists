title: Determine SKU and bandwidth required
description: The way you're charged for your ExpressRoute usage varies between the
  three different SKU types. With Local SKU, you're automatically charged with an
  Unlimited data plan. With Standard and Premium SKU, you can select between a Metered
  or an Unlimited data plan. All ingress data are free of charge except when using
  the Global Reach add-on. It's important to understand which SKU types and data plan
  works best for your workload to best optimize cost and budget. For more information
