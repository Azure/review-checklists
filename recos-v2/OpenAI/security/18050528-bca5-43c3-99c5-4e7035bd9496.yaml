title: 'Protect confidentiality: If you upload training data to Azure OpenAI, use
  customer-managed keys for data encryption, implement a key-rotation strategy, and
  delete training, validation, and training results data. If you use an external data
  store for training data, follow security best practices for that store. For example,
  for Azure Blob Storage, use customer-managed keys for encryption and implement a
  key-rotation strategy. Use managed identity-based access, implement a network perimeter
  by using private endpoints, and enable access logs.'
