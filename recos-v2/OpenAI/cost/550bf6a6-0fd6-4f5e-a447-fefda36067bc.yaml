  client needs. This saves money by ensuring the model doesn't generate an overly
  long response that consumes more tokens than necessary.

title: 'Design client code to set limits: Your custom clients should use the limit
  features of the Azure OpenAI completions API, such as maximum limit on the number
  of tokens per model (`max_tokens`) or number of completions to generation (`n`).
  Setting limits ensures that the server doesn''t produce more than the client needs.'
