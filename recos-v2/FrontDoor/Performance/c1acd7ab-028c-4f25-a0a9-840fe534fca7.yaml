title: Evaluate whether you should enable session affinity when requests from the
  same user should be directed to the same back-end server.  From a reliability perspective,
  we don't recommend this approach. If you use this option, the application should
  gracefully recover without disrupting user sessions.  There's also a tradeoff on
  load balancing because it restricts the flexibility of distributing traffic across
  multiple back ends evenly.
