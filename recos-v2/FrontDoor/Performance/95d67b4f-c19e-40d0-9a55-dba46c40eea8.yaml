title: Review the location of origin servers. Your origin servers' location impacts
  the responsiveness of your application. Origin servers should be closer to the users.
  Azure Front Door ensures that users from a specific location access the nearest
  Azure Front Door entry point. The performance benefits include faster user experience,
  better use of latency-based routing by Azure Front Door, and minimized data transfer
  time by using caching, which stores content closer to users.
