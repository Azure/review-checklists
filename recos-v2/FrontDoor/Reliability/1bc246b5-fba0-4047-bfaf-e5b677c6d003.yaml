title: Choose your deployment strategy. The fundamental deployment approaches are
  active-active and active-passive. Active-active deployment means that multiple environments
  or stamps that run the workload serve traffic. Active-passive deployment means that
  only the primary region handles all traffic, but it fails over to the secondary
  region when necessary. In a multiregion deployment, stamps run in different regions
  for higher availability with a global load balancer, like Azure Front Door, that
  distributes traffic. Therefore, it's important to configure the load balancer for
  the appropriate deployment approach.
