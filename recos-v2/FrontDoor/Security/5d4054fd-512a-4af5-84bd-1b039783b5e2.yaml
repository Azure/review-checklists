title: Enable end-to-end TLS, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, and managed TLS certificates
  when applicable.  Review the TLS best practices for Azure Front Door.  Use TLS version
  1.2 as the minimum allowed version with ciphers that are relevant for your application.  Azure
  Front Door managed certificates should be your default choice for ease of operations.
  However, if you want to manage the lifecycle of the certificates, use your own certificates
  in Azure Front Door custom domain endpoints and store them in Key Vault.
