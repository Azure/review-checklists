title: Ensure a stable IP for outbound communications towards internet addresses
description: You can provide a stable outbound IP by using VNet integration and using
  a VNet NAT Gateway or an NVA like Azure Firewall.  This allows the receiving party
  to allow-list based on IP, should that be needed.  Note that for communications
  towards Azure Services often there's no need to depend on the IP address and mechanics
  like Service Endpoints should be used instead.  (Also the use of private endpoints
  on the receiving end avoids for SNAT to happen and provides a stable outbound IP
  range.)
