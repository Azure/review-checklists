description: 'While multiple VNets can connect via the same ExpressRoute gateway,
  Microsoft recommends using alternatives like VNet peering, Azure Firewall, NVA,
  Azure Route Server, site-to-site VPN, virtual WAN, or SD-WAN for VNet-to-VNet communication
  to optimize network performance and management.
