text: Enable zone redundancy for Azure Cache for Redis. Azure Cache for Redis supports
  zone redundant configurations in the Premium and Enterprise tiers. A zone redundant
  cache can place its nodes across different Azure Availability Zones in the same
  region. It eliminates data center or AZ outage as a single point of failure and
  increases the overall availability of your cache.
