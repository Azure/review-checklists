description: For internal apps organizations often open the whole AKS subnet in their
  firewalls. This opens network access to the nodes too, and potentially to the pods
  as well (if using Azure CNI). If LoadBalancer IPs are in a different subnet, only
  this one needs to be available to the app clients. Another reason is that if the
  IP addresses in the AKS subnet are a scarce resource, consuming its IP addresses
  for services will reduce the maximum scalability of the cluster .
