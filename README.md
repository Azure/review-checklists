# Azure Review Checklists

A common request of many organisations, starting with the public cloud, is to have their design double-checked to make sure that best practices are being followed. The scope of this exercise could vary, from generic Azure landing zones to workload-specific deployments.

When doing Azure design reviews (or any review for that matter), Microsoft employees and Microsoft partners often leverage Excel spreadsheets as the medium of choice to document findings and track design improvements and recommendations. A problem with Excel spreadsheets is that they are not easily subject to revision control. Additionally, team collaboration with branching, issues, pull requests, reviews, and others is difficult at bestâ€”impossible in most cases.

There are three ways to use these checklists.

1) Via [Excel](./spreadsheet/README.md)
2) Via Web Application hosted at [https://aka.ms/ftaaas](https://aka.ms/ftaaas).
3) [Azure Resource Graph Queries](./scripts/README.md)
