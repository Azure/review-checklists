# Contributing

For any contribution, please create the proposed changes in a forked repo, and open a Pull Request against the main branch.

## Changes to existing checklists

There are two ways in which you can send changes to the existing checklists:

### Option 1: Modifying the JSON file directly

Modify the relevant `.en.json` file in the `checklists` directory, either in the Github portal or in your own clone with your favorite text editor, and send a Pull Request to the main branch. Each checklist (LZ, AKS, AVD) has a predefined set of owners that will review the individual PRs (see [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS)).

If you are adding new rules, make sure to include unique GUIDs for each. You can use your favorite GUID generation tool to generate new random GUIDs, such as [https://guidgenerator.com/](https://guidgenerator.com/)

### Option 2: Using the spreadsheet to create new JSON files

Optionally, you can use the provided Excel spreadsheet to do changes to the existing checklists:

1. Open the [Excel spreadsheet](./spreadsheet/review_checklist.xlsm), and load the English version of any of the supported checklist
1. Do any change you want. Some remarks:
    - If adding or changing hyperlinks, it is OK putting the raw URL in the corresponding cell. The export mechanism will take care of removing the localization
    - If adding new rules, you can leave the GUID field empty, the export mechanism will generate a new random GUID
1. Export the checklist to a JSON file (using the button "Export checklist to JSON"), which you can check into the Github repository (refer to [Option 1: Modifying the JSON file directly](#option-1-modifying-the-jSON-file-directly))

## Adding Resource Graph queries

When adding Azure Resource Graph queries, two different queries are expected:

* **Success** query, returning a list of resources that are **compliant** with the checklist recommendation
* **Failure** query, returning a list of resources that are **non-compliant** with the checklist recommendation

Both queries should return at least the following fields for each resource:

- id
- name
- resourceGroup (if applicable, subscriptions do not have a resource group)

## Changes to the spreadsheet

Modify the file [spreadsheet/review_checklist.xlsm](./spreadsheet/review_checklist.xlsm) in your own fork, and send a Pull Request to the main branch. Make sure not to check in temporary files (by closing the Excel spreadsheet before git-adding the files).

## Forking the repo

If you fork this repository you will need to create an Azure Translator in Azure, and define three secrets in your repo so that automatic translation works:

- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_ENDPOINT`: containing the endpoint URL for your Azure Translator. You will find this in the Azure Portal, in the blade "Keys and Endpoint" of your Azure Translator, under "Text Translation".
- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_REGION` (optional): containing the region for your Azure Translator. You will find this in the Azure Portal, in the blade "Keys and Endpoint" of your Azure Translator, under "Location/Region".
- `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`: the subscription key for your Azure Translator. You will find this in the Azure Portal, in the blade "Keys and Endpoint" of your Azure Translator, under "Key 1" or "Key 2" (you can use either of them).
