title: Use key autorotation for vSAN datastore customer-managed keys
description: When using customer-managed keys for encrypting vSAN datastores, leveraging
  Azure Key Vault for central management and accessing them via a managed identity
  linked to the private cloud is advised. The expiration of these keys can render
  the vSAN datastore and its associated workloads inaccessible.
