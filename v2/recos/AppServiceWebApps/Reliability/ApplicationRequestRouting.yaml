title: (App Service) Consider disabling the application request routing (ARR) affinity
  feature. ARR affinity creates sticky sessions that redirect users to the node that
  handled their previous requests.
description: Incoming requests are evenly distributed across all available nodes when
  you disable ARR affinity. Evenly distributed requests prevent traffic from overwhelming
  any single node. Requests can be seamlessly redirected to other healthy nodes if
  a node is unavailable.  Avoid session affinity to ensure that your App Service instance
  remains stateless. A stateless App Service reduces complexity and ensures consistent
  behavior across nodes.  Remove sticky sessions so that App Service can add or remove
  instances to scale horizontally.
