title: (App Service) valuate whether App Service built-in authentication is the right
  mechanism to authenticate users that access your application. App Service built-in
  authentication integrates with Microsoft Entra ID. This feature handles token validation
  and user identity management across multiple sign-in providers and supports OpenID
  Connect. With this feature, you don't have authorization at a granular level, and
  you don't have a mechanism to test authentication.
description: When you use this feature, you don't have to use authentication libraries
  in application code, which reduces complexity. The user is already authenticated
  when a request reaches the application.
