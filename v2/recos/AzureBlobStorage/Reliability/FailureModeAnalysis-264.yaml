title: 'Define reliability and recovery targets: Review the Azure service-level agreements
  (SLAs). Derive the service-level objective (SLO) for the storage account. For example,
  the SLO might be affected by the redundancy configuration that you chose. Consider
  the effect of a regional outage, the potential for data loss, and the time required
  to restore access after an outage. Also consider the availability of any internal
  dependencies that you identified as part of your failure mode analysis.'
