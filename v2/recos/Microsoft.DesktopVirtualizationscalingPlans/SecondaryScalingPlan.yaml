title: Scaling plans should be created per region and not scaled across regions
description: Each region has its own scaling plans assigned to host pools within that
  region. However, these plans can become inaccessible if there's a regional failure.
  To mitigate this risk, it's advisable to create a secondary scaling plan in another
  region.
