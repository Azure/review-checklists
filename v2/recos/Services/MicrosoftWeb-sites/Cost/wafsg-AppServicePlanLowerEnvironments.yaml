title: (App Service plan) Choose Free or Basic tiers for lower environments. We recommend
  these tiers for experimental use. Remove the tiers when you no longer need them.
description: The Free and Basic tiers are budget-friendly compared to higher tiers.
  They provide a cost-effective solution for nonproduction environments that don't
  need the full features and performance of premium plans.
