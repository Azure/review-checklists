name: revcl-GbSecondCalculationAsyncOperation
title: Am I billed for 'await time'? This question is typically asked in the context
  of a C# function that does an async operation and waits for the result, e.g. await
  Task.Delay(1000) or await client.GetAsync('http://google.com'). The answer is yes
  - the GB second calculation is based on the start and end time of the function and
  the memory usage over that period. What actually happens over that time in terms
  of CPU activity is not factored into the calculation.One exception to this rule
  is if you are using durable functions. You are not billed for time spent at awaits
  in orchestrator functions.apply demand shaping techinques where possible (dev environments?)
