title: 'Understand usage meters: Azure charges an hourly rate, prorated to the second,
  based on your App Service plan''s pricing tier. Charges apply to each scaled-out
  instance in your plan, based on the time that you allocate the VM instance. Pay
  attention to underused compute resources that might increase your costs as a result
  of overallocation due to suboptimal SKU selection, or poorly configured scale-in
  configuration.'
