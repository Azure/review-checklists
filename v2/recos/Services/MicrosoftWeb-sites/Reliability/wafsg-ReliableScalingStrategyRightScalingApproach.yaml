title: 'Have a reliable scaling strategy: Unexpected load on an application can make
  it unreliable. Consider the right scaling approach based on your workload characteristics.
  You can sometimes scale up to handle the load. However, if the load continues to
  increase, scale out to new instances. Prefer automatic scaling over manual approaches.
  Always maintain a buffer of extra capacity during scaling operations to prevent
  performance degradation.'
