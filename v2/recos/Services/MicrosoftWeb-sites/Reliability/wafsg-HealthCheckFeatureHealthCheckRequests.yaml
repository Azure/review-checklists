title: (App Service) Enable the health check feature and provide a path that responds
  to the health check requests.
description: Health checks can detect problems early. Then the system can automatically
  take corrective actions when a health check request fails.  The load balancer routes
  traffic away from unhealthy instances, which directs users to healthy nodes.
