name: wafsg-AppServicePlanZoneRedundancy
title: (App Service plan) Enable zone redundancy. Consider provisioning more than
  three instances to enhance fault tolerance.  Check regional support for zone redundancy
  because not all regions offer this feature.
description: Your application can withstand failures in a single zone when multiple
  instances are spread across zones. Traffic automatically shifts to healthy instances
  in other zones and maintains application reliability if one zone is unavailable.
