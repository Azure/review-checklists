title: 'Optimize your scaling strategy: When possible, use autoscaling instead of
  manually adjusting the number of instances as application load changes. With autoscaling,
  App Service adjusts server capacity based on predefined rules or triggers. Make
  sure you do adequate performance testing and set the right rules for the right triggers.'
