title: 'Manage releases: Use deployment slots to manage releases effectively. You
  can deploy your application to a slot, perform testing, and validate its functionality.
  After verification, you can seamlessly move the app to production. This process
  doesn''t incur extra costs because the slot runs in the same virtual machine (VM)
  environment as the production instance.'
