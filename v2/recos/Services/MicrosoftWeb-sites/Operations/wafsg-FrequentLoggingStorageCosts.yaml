title: '(App Service) Enable diagnostics logs for the application and the instance.  Frequent
  logging can slow down the performance of the system, add to storage costs, and introduce
  risk if you have unsecure access to logs. Follow these best practices:  - Log the
  right level of information.  - Set retention policies.  - Keep an audit trail of
  authorized access and unauthorized attempts. - Treat logs as data and apply data-protection
  controls.'
description: Diagnostic logs provide valuable insights into your app's behavior. Monitor
  traffic patterns and identify anomalies.
