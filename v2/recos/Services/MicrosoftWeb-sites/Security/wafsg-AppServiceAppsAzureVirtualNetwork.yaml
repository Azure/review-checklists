  identity segmentation. For example, implement role-based access control (RBAC) to
  assign specific permissions based on roles. Follow the principle of least privilege
  to limit access rights to only what''s necessary. Also create segmentation at the
  network level. Inject App Service apps in an Azure virtual network for isolation
  and define network security groups (NSGs) to filter traffic.'
