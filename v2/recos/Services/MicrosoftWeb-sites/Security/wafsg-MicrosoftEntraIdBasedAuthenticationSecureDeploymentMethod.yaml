title: '(App Service) To implement hardening:  - Disable basic authentication that
  uses a username and password in favor of Microsoft Entra ID-based authentication.  -
  Turn off remote debugging so that inbound ports aren''t opened. - Enable CORS policies
  to tighten incoming requests.  - Disable protocols, such as FTP.'
description: We don't recommend basic authentication as a secure deployment method.
  Microsoft Entra ID employs OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication, which offers numerous
  advantages and enhancements that address the limitations that are associated with
  basic authentication.  Policies restrict access to application resources, only allow
  requests from specific domains, and secure cross-region requests.
