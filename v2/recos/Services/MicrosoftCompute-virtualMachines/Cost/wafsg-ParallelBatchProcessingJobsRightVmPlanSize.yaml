title: (VMs, scale set) Choose the right VM plan size and SKU. Identify the best VM
  sizes for your workload.  Use the VM selector to identify the best VM for your workload.
  See Windows and Linux pricing.  For workloads like highly parallel batch processing
  jobs that can tolerate some interruptions, consider using Azure Spot Virtual Machines.
  Spot virtual machines are good for experimenting, developing, and testing large-scale
  solutions.
description: SKUs are priced according to the capabilities that they offer. If you
  don't need advanced capabilities, don't overspend on SKUs.  Spot virtual machines
  take advantage of the surplus capacity in Azure at a lower cost.
