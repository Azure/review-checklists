title: (Scale set) Assign a managed identity to scale sets. All VMs in the scale set
  get the same identity through the specified VM profile.  (VMs) You can also assign
  a managed identity to individual VMs when you create them and then add it to a scale
  set if needed.
description: When VMs communicate with other resources, they cross a trust boundary.
  Scale sets and VMs should authenticate their identity before communication is allowed.
  Microsoft Entra ID handles that authentication by using managed identities.
