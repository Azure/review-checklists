title: (Scale set) Choose VM SKUs with security features. For example, some SKUs support
  BitLocker encryption, and confidential computing provides encryption of data-in-use.  Review
  the features to understand the limitations.
description: Azure-provided features are based on signals that are captured across
  many tenants and can protect resources better than custom controls. You can also
  use policies to enforce those controls.
