name: wafsg-TheVmInstancesScaleSet
title: (Scale set) Deploy across availability zones on scale sets. Set up at least
  two instances in each zone. Zone balancing equally spreads the instances across
  zones.
description: The VM instances are provisioned in physically separate locations within
  each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures.  Keep in mind that, depending
  on resource availability, there might be an uneven number of instances across zones.
  Zone balancing supports availability by making sure that, if one zone is down, the
  other zones have sufficient instances.  Two instances in each zone provide a buffer
  during upgrades.
