title: Plan for ExpressRoute circuit or ExpressRoute Direct
description: During the initial planning phase, you want to decide whether you want
  to configure an ExpressRoute circuit or an ExpressRoute Direct connection. An ExpressRoute
  circuit allows a private dedicated connection into Azure with the help of a connectivity
  provider. ExpressRoute Direct allows you to extend on-premises network directly
  into the Microsoft network at a peering location. You also need to identify the
  bandwidth requirement and the SKU type requirement for your business needs.
