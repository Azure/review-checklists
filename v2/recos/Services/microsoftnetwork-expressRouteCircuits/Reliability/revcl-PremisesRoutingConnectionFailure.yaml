name: revcl-PremisesRoutingConnectionFailure
title: 'If using ExpressRoute, your on-premises routing should be dynamic: in the
  event of a connection failure it should converge to the remaining connection of
  the circuit. Load should be shared across both connections ideally as active/active,
  although active/passive is supported too.'
