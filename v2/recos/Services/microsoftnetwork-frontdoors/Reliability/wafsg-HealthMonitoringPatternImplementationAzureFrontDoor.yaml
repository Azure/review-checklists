title: Set up health probes on the origin. Configure Azure Front Door to conduct health
  checks to determine if the back-end instance is available and ready to continue
  receiving requests.
description: Enabled health probes are part of the health monitoring pattern implementation.
  Health probes make sure that Azure Front Door only routes traffic to instances that
  are healthy enough to handle requests.  For more information, see Best practices
  on health probes.
