title: Implement the health endpoint monitoring pattern. Your application should expose
  health endpoints, which aggregate the state of the critical services and dependencies
  that your application needs to serve requests. Azure Front Door health probes use
  the endpoint to detect origin servers' health. For more information, see Health
  Endpoint Monitoring pattern.
