name: wafsg-AllowableLatencyRangeBestOriginResource
title: Choose a routing method that supports your deployment strategy.  The weighted
  method, which distributes traffic based on the configured weight coefficient, supports
  active-active models.  A priority-based value that configures the primary region
  to receive all traffic and send traffic to the secondary region as a backup supports
  active-passive models.  Combine the preceding methods with latency so that the origin
  with the lowest latency receives traffic.
description: You can select the best origin resource by using a series of decision
  steps and your design. The selected origin serves traffic within the allowable latency
  range in the specified ratio of weights.
