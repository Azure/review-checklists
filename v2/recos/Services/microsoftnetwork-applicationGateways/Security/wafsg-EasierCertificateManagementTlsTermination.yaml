title: Use AppGateway for TLS termination
description: There are advantages of using Application Gateway for TLS termination:-
  Performance improves because requests going to different backends to have to re-authenticate
  to each backend.- Better utilization of backend servers because they don't have
  to perform TLS processing- Intelligent routing by accessing the request content.-
  Easier certificate management because the certificate only needs to be installed
  on Application Gateway.
