title: 'Workload architecture: Use meaningful workload scaling metrics.'
description: Not all scale decisions can be derived from CPU or memory metrics. Often
  scale considerations will come from more complex or even external data points. Use
  KEDA to build a meaningful auto scale ruleset based on signals that are specific
  to your workload.
