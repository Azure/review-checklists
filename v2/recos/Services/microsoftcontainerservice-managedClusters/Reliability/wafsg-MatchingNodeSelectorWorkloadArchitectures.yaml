name: wafsg-MatchingNodeSelectorWorkloadArchitectures
title: 'Cluster and workload architectures: Control pod scheduling using node selectors
  and affinity.'
description: Allows the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads by hardware
  in the node. Unlike tolerations, pods without a matching node selector can be scheduled
  on labeled nodes, which allows unused resources on the nodes to consume, but gives
  priority to pods that define the matching node selector. Use node affinity for more
  flexibility, which allows you to define what happens if the pod can't be matched
  with a node.
