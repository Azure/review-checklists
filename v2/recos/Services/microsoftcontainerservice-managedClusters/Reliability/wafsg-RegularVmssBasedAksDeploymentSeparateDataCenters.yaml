title: 'Cluster architecture: Use availability zones to maximize resilience within
  an Azure region by distributing AKS agent nodes across physically separate data
  centers.'
description: By spreading node pools across multiple zones, nodes in one node pool
  will continue running even if another zone has gone down. If colocality requirements
  exist, either a regular VMSS-based AKS deployment into a single zone or proximity
  placement groups can be used to minimize internode latency.
