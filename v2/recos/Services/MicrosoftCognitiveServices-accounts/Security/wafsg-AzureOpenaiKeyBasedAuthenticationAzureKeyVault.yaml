title: 'Secure keys: If your architecture requires Azure OpenAI key-based authentication,
  store those keys in Azure Key Vault, not in application code.'
description: Separating secrets from code by storing them in Key Vault reduces the
  chance of leaking secrets. Separation also facilitates central management of secrets,
  easing responsibilities like key rotation.
