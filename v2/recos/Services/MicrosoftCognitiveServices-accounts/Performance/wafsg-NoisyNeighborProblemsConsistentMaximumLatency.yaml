title: 'Capacity: Use provisioned throughput for production workloads. Provisioned
  throughput offers dedicated memory and compute, reserved capacity, and consistent
  maximum latency for the specified model version. The pay-as-you-go offering can
  suffer from noisy neighbor problems like increased latency and throttling in regions
  under heavy use. Also, the pay-as-you-go approach doesn''t offer guaranteed capacity.'
