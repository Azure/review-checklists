title: 'Resiliency: If you''re using provisioned throughput, consider also deploying
  a pay-as-you-go instance to handle overflow. You can route calls to the pay-as-you-go
  instance via your gateway when your provisioned throughput model is throttled. You
  can also use monitoring to predict when the model will be throttled and preemptively
  route calls to the pay-as-you-go instance.'
