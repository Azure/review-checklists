title: 'Select appropriate compute services for model training: Consider Machine Learning
  compute clusters over compute instances for model training if you require autoscaling.Optimize
  your compute resources based on the training requirements. First choose between
  CPUs and GPUs. Default to CPUs, but consider GPUs for workloads such as deep learning,
  image or video processing, or large amounts of data. Next, choose the image SKU
  that best suits your workload.Use testing to choose the compute option that optimizes
  cost against training time when determining your baseline.'
description: Selecting the right compute is critical as it directly impacts the training
  time. Choosing the right SKU and CPU versus GPU ensures your model training can
  meet your requirements and performance targets. Choosing a low-performance SKU that's
  overused can lead to prohibitively long training times and performance problems.
  Compute clusters provide the ability to improve performance by scaling out workloads
  that support horizontal scaling. This method provides flexibility for handling workloads
  with different demands and lets you add or remove machines as needed.
