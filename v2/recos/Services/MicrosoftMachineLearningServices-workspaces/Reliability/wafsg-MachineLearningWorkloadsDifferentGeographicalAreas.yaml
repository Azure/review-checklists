title: 'Multi-region model deployment: For enhanced reliability and availability,
  consider a multi-region deployment environment when possible.'
description: A multi-region deployment ensures that your Machine Learning workloads
  continue to run even if one region experiences an outage. Multi-region deployment
  improves load distribution across regions, potentially enhancing performance for
  users located in different geographical areas. For more information, see Failover
  for business continuity and disaster recovery.
