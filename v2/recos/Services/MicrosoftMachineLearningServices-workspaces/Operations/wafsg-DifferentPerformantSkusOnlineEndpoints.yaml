title: 'Monitor infrastructure: If your models are deployed to online endpoints, enable
  Application Insights to monitor online endpoints and deployments.Monitor training
  infrastructure to ensure you''re meeting your baseline requirements.Ensure you''re
  collecting resource logs for Machine Learning.'
description: Monitoring endpoints gives you visibility into metrics such as request
  latency and requests per minute. You can compare your performance versus your baseline
  and use this information to make changes to compute resources accordingly. Monitoring
  metrics such as network bytes can alert you if you're approaching quota limits and
  prevent throttling.Likewise, monitoring your training environment provides you with
  the information to make changes to your training environment. Use that information
  to decide to scale in or out, scale up or down with different performant SKUs, or
  choose between CPUs or GPUs.
