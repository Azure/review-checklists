title: 'Managed virtual network isolation: Configure managed virtual network isolation
  for Machine Learning. When you enable managed virtual network isolation, a managed
  virtual network is created for the workspace. Managed compute resources you create
  for the workspace automatically use this managed virtual network. If you can''t
  implement managed virtual network isolation, then you must follow the network topology
  recommendations to separate compute into a dedicated subnet away from the rest of
  the resources in the solution, including the private endpoints for workspace resources.'
description: Managed virtual network isolation enhances security by isolating your
  workspace from other networks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. In a scenario
  in which a breach occurs in another network within your organization, the isolated
  network of your Machine Learning workspace remains unaffected, protecting your machine
  learning workloads.
