title: 'Integrity: Implement use case segregation for Machine Learning workspaces
  by setting up workspaces based on specific use cases or projects. This approach
  adheres to the principle of least privilege by ensuring that workspaces are only
  accessible to individuals that require access to data and experimentation assets
  for the use case or project.'
