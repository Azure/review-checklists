title: 'Strict Machine Learning workspace access controls: Use Microsoft Entra ID
  groups to manage workspace access and adhere to the principle of least privilege
  for RBAC.'
description: Strict workspace access controls enhance security by ensuring that individuals
  have only the necessary permissions for their role. A data scientist, for instance,
  might have access to run experiments but not to modify security settings, minimizing
  potential security risks.
