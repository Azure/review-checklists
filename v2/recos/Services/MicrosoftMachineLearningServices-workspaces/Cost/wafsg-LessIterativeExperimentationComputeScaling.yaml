title: 'Optimize compute scaling: Configure your compute clusters for autoscaling
  to ensure you only use what you need.For training clusters, set the minimum number
  of nodes to 0 and configure the amount of time the node is idle to an appropriate
  time. For less iterative experimentation, reduce the time to save costs. For more
  iterative experimentation, use a higher time to prevent paying for scaling up or
  down after each change.'
description: Configure autoscaling for compute clusters to scale down when their usage
  is low.  Set the minimum number of nodes to 0 for training clusters to scale down
  to 0 when not in use.
