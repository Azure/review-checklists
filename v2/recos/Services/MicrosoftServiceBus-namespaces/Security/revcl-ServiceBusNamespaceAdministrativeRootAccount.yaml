title: Avoid using root account when it is not necessary
description: 'When you create a Service Bus namespace, a SAS rule named RootManageSharedAccessKey
  is automatically created for the namespace. This policy has Manage permissions for
  the entire namespace. It''s recommended that you treat this rule like an administrative
  root account and don''t use it in your application.  Using AAD as an authentication
  provider with RBAC is recommended. '
