title: Consider using private endpoints to access Azure Service Bus and disable public
  network access when applicable.
description: 'Azure Service Bus by default has a public IP address and is Internet-reachable.
  Private endpoints allow traffic between your virtual network and Azure Service Bus
  traverses over the Microsoft backbone network. In addition to that, you should disable
  public endpoints if those are not used. '
