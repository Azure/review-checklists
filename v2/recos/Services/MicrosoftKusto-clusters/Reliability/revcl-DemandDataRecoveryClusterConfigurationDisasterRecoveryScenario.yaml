title: For applications, where cost is a concern and can withstand some downtime during
  failure, create on-demand data recovery cluster configuration
description: This solution offers the least resiliency (highest RPO and RTO), is the
  lowest in cost and highest in effort. In this configuration, there's no data recovery
  cluster. Configure continuous export of curated data (unless raw and intermediate
  data is also required) to a storage account that is configured GRS (Geo Redundant
  Storage). A data recovery cluster is spun up if there is a disaster recovery scenario.
  At that time, DDLs, configuration, policies, and processes are applied. Data is
  ingested from storage with the ingestion property kustoCreationTime to over-ride
  the ingestion time that defaults to system time.
