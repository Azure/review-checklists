title: Azure Bot Service runs in active-active mode for both global and regional services.
  When an outage occurs, you don't need to detect errors or manage the service. Azure
  Bot Service automatically performs auto failover and auto recovery in a multi-region
  geographical architecture. For the EU bot regional service, Azure Bot Service provides
  two full regions inside Europe with active/active replication to ensure redundancy.
  For the global bot service, all available regions/geographies can be served as the
  global footprint.
