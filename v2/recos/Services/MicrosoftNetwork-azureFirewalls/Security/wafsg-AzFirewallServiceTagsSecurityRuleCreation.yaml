title: Use Service Tags in Network Rules to enable selective access to specific Microsoft
  services.
description: 'A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize
  complexity for security rule creation. Using Service Tags in Network Rules, it is
  possible to enable outbound access to specific services in Azure, Dynamics and Office
  365 without opening wide ranges of IP addresses. Azure will maintain automatically
  the mapping between these tags and underlying IP addresses used by each service.
  The list of Service Tags available to Azure Firewall are listed here: Az Firewall
  Service Tags.'
