title: Configure supported third-party software as a service (SaaS) security providers
  within Firewall Manager if you want to use these solutions to protect outbound connections.
description: You can use your familiar, best-in-breed, third-party SECaaS offerings
  to protect internet access for your users. This scenario does require Azure Virtual
  WAN with a S2S VPN Gateway in the Hub, as it uses an IPSec tunnel to connect to
  the provider's infrastructure. SECaaS providers might charge additional license
  fees and limit throughput on IPSec connections. Alternative solutions such as ZScaler
  Cloud Connector exist and might be more suitable.
