title: Configure user-defined routes (UDR) to force traffic through Azure Firewall.
description: In a traditional Hub & Spokes architecture, configure UDRs to force traffic
  through Azure Firewall for `SpoketoSpoke`, `SpoketoInternet`, and `SpoketoHybrid`
  connectivity. In Azure Virtual WAN, instead, configure Routing Intent and Policies
  to redirect private and/or Internet traffic through the Azure Firewall instance
  integrated into the hub.
