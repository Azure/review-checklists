title: Maintain regular backups of Azure Policy artifacts.
description: If Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach is used to maintain Azure Firewall
  and all dependencies then backup and versioning of Azure Firewall Policies should
  be already in place. If not, a companion mechanism based on external Logic App can
  be deployed to automate and provide an effective solution.
