title: Use Structured Firewall Logs format.
description: Structured Firewall Logs are a type of log data that are organized in
  a specific new format. They use a predefined schema to structure log data in a way
  that makes it easy to search, filter, and analyze. The latest monitoring tools are
  based on this type of logs hence it is often a pre-requisite. Use the previous Diagnostic
  Logs format only if there is an existing tool with a pre-requisite on that. Do not
  enable both logging formats at the same time.
