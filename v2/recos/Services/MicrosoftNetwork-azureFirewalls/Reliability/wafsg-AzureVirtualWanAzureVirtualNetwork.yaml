title: In multi-region environments, deploy an Azure Firewall instance per region.
description: For traditional Hub & Spokes architectures, multi-region details are
  explained in this article. For secured virtual hubs (Azure Virtual WAN), Routing
  Intent and Policies must be configured to secure inter-hub and branch-to-branch
  communications. For workloads designed to be resistant to failures and fault tolerant,
  remember to consider that instances of Azure Firewall and Azure Virtual Network
  as regional resources.
