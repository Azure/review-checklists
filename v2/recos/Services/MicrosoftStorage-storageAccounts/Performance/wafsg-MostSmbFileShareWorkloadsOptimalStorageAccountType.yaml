title: 'Choose the optimal storage account type: If your workload requires large amounts
  of IOPS, extremely fast data transfer speeds, or very low latency, then you should
  choose premium (FileStorage) storage accounts. You can use a standard general-purpose
  v2 account for most SMB file share workloads. The primary tradeoff between the two
  storage account types is cost versus performance.'
