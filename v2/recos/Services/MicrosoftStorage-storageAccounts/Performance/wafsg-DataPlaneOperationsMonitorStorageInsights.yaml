title: 'Collect performance data: Monitor your storage account to identify performance
  bottlenecks that occur from throttling. For more information, see Monitoring your
  storage service with Monitor Storage insights. Use both metrics and logs. Metrics
  provide numbers such as throttling errors. Logs describe activity. If you see throttling
  metrics, you can use logs to identity which clients are receiving throttling errors.
