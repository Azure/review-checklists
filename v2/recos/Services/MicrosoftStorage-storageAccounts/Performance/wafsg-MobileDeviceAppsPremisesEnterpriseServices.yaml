title: Provision storage accounts in the same region where dependent resources are
  placed. For applications that aren't hosted on Azure, such as mobile device apps
  or on-premises enterprise services, locate the storage account in a region nearer
  to those clients. For more information, see Azure geographies.If clients from a
  different region don't require the same data, then create a separate account in
  each region.If clients from a different region require only some data, consider
  using an object-replication policy to asynchronously copy relevant objects to a
  storage account in the other region.
description: Reducing the physical distance between the storage account and VMs, services,
  and on-premises clients can improve performance and reduce network latency. Reducing
  the physical distance also reduces cost for applications hosted in Azure because
  bandwidth usage within a single region is free.
