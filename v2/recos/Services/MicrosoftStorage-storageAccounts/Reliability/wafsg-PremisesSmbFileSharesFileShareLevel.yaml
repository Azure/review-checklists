title: "As a part of your backup and recovery strategy, enable\u202Fsoft delete\u202F\
  and\u202Fuse snapshots for point-in-time restore. You can use Azure Backup to back\
  \ up your SMB file shares. You can also use Azure File Sync to back up on-premises\
  \ SMB file shares to an Azure file share.  Azure Backup also allows you to do a\
  \ vaulted backup (preview) of Azure Files to protect your data from ransomware attacks\
  \ or source data loss due to a malicious actor or rogue admin. By using vaulted\
  \ backup, Azure Backup copies and stores data in the Recovery Services vault. This\
  \ creates an offsite copy of data that you can retain for up to 99 years. Azure\
  \ Backup creates and manages the recovery points as per the schedule and retention\
  \ defined in the backup policy. Learn more."
description: Soft delete works on a file share level to protect Azure file shares
  against accidental deletion. Point-in-time restore protects against accidental deletion
  or corruption because you can restore file shares to an earlier state. For more
  information, see Data protection overview.
