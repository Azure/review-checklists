title: 'Design applications: Design your applications to seamlessly shift so that
  they read data from a secondary region if the primary region is unavailable. This
  design consideration only applies to geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant
  storage (GZRS) configurations. Design your applications to properly handle outages,
  which reduces downtime for customers.'
