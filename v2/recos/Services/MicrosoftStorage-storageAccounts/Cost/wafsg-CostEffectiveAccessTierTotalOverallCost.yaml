title: 'After you migrate your workload, if you use standard file shares, carefully
  choose the most cost effective access tier for your file share: hot, cool, or transaction
  optimized. After you operate for a few days or weeks with regular usage, you can
  insert your transaction counts in the pricing calculator to figure out which tier
  best suits your workload. Most customers should choose cool even if they actively
  use the share. But you should examine each share and compare the balance of storage
  capacity to transactions to determine your tier. If transaction costs make up a
  significant percentage of your bill, the savings from using the cool access tier
  often offsets this cost and minimizes the total overall cost. We recommend that
  you move standard file shares between access tiers only when necessary to optimize
  for changes in your workload pattern. Each move incurs transactions. For more information,
  see Switching between standard tiers.'
