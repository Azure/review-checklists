name: wafsg-MinimumRecommendedRetentionPeriodPremiumFileShares
title: Set retention periods for the soft-delete feature, especially when you first
  start using it. Consider starting with a short retention period to better understand
  how the feature affects your bill. The minimum recommended retention period is seven
  days. When you soft delete standard and premium file shares, they're billed as used
  capacity rather than provisioned capacity. And premium file shares are billed at
  the snapshot rate while in the soft-delete state. Standard file shares are billed
  at the regular rate while in the soft-delete state.
description: Set a retention period so that soft-deleted files don't pile up and increase
  the cost of capacity. After the configured retention period, permanently deleted
  data doesn't incur cost.
