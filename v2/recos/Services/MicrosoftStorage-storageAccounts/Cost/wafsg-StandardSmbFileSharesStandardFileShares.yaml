title: 'Create a storage account for your file share, and choose a redundancy level:
  Choose either a standard (GPv2) or premium (FileStorage) account. The redundancy
  level that you choose affects cost. The more redundancy, the higher the cost. Locally
  redundant storage (LRS) is the most affordable. GRS is only available for standard
  SMB file shares. Standard file shares only show transaction information at the storage
  account level, so we recommend that you deploy only one file share in each storage
  account to ensure full billing visibility.'
