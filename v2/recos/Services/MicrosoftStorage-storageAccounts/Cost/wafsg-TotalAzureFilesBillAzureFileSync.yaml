title: Monitor snapshot usage. Snapshots incur charges, but they're billed based on
  the differential storage usage of each snapshot. You pay only for the difference
  in each snapshot. For more information, see Snapshots. Azure File Sync takes share-level
  and file-level snapshots as part of regular usage, which can increase your total
  Azure Files bill.
description: Differential snapshots ensure that you're not billed multiple times for
  storing the same data. However, you should still monitor snapshot usage to help
  reduce your Azure Files bill.
