title: 'Estimate the cost of capacity and operations: You can model the costs associated
  with data storage, ingress, and egress by using the Azure pricing calculator. Use
  fields to compare the cost associated with various regions, account types, namespace
  types, and redundancy configurations. For certain scenarios, you can use sample
  calculations and worksheets available in Microsoft documentation. For example, you
  can estimate the cost of archiving data or estimate the cost of using the AzCopy
  command to transfer blobs.'
