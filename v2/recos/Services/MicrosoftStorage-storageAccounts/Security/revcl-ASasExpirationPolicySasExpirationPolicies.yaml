title: Consider configuring an SAS expiration policy
description: A SAS expiration policy specifies a recommended interval over which the
  SAS is valid. SAS expiration policies apply to a service SAS or an account SAS.
  When a user generates service SAS or an account SAS with a validity interval that
  is larger than the recommended interval, they'll see a warning.
