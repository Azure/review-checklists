title: Consider storing connection strings in Azure KeyVault (in scenarios where managed
  identities are not possible)
description: Ideally, your application should be using a managed identity to authenticate
  to Azure Storage. If that is not possible, consider having the storage credential
  (connection string, storage account key, SAS, service principal credential) in Azure
  KeyVault or an equivalent service.
