title: 'Detect threats: Enable Microsoft Defender for Storage to detect potentially
  harmful attempts to access or exploit your Azure file shares over SMB or FileREST
  protocols. Subscription administrators get email alerts with details of suspicious
  activity and recommendations about how to investigate and remediate threats. Defender
  for Storage doesn''t support antivirus capabilities for Azure file shares. If you
  use Defender for Storage, transaction-heavy file shares incur significant costs,
  so consider opting out of Defender for Storage for specific storage accounts.'
