title: Determine how data at rest should be encrypted. Understand the thread model
  for data.
description: Data at rest is always encrypted server-side, and in addition might be
  encrypted client-side as well. Server-side encryption might happen using a platform-managed
  key (default) or customer-managed key. Client-side encryption might happen by either
  having the client supply an encryption/decryption key on a per-blob basis to Azure
  storage, or by completely handling encryption on the client-side. thus not relying
  on Azure Storage at all for confidentiality guarantees.
