title: When using SAS, prefer 'user delegation SAS' over storage-account-key based
  SAS.
description: 'A user delegation SAS is secured with Azure Active Directory (Azure
  AD) credentials and also by the permissions specified for the SAS. A user delegation
  SAS is analogous to a service SAS in terms of its scope and function, but offers
  security benefits over the service SAS. '
