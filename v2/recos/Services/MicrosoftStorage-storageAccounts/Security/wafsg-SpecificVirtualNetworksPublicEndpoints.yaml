title: Disable traffic to the public endpoints of your storage account. Create private
  endpoints for clients that run in Azure. Enable the public endpoint only if clients
  and services external to Azure require direct access to your storage account. Enable
  firewall rules that limit access to specific virtual networks.
description: Start with zero access and then incrementally authorize the lowest levels
  of access required for clients and services to minimize the risk of creating unnecessary
  openings for attackers.
