title: Consider disabling public network access to your storage account. Enable public
  network access only if SMB clients and services that are external to Azure require
  access to your storage account. If you disable public network access,create a private
  endpoint for your storage account. Standard data processing rates for private endpoints
  apply. A private endpoint doesn't block connections to the public endpoint. You
  should still disable public network access as previously described. If you don't
  require a static IP address for your file share and want to avoid the cost of private
  endpoints, you can instead restrict public endpoint access to specific virtual networks
  and IP addresses.
description: Network traffic travels over the Microsoft backbone network instead of
  the public internet, which eliminates risk exposure from the public internet.
