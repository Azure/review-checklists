title: 'Model training resiliency: Use checkpointing features supported by Machine
  Learning including Azure Container for PyTorch, the TensorFlow Estimator class,
  or the Run object and the FileDataset class that support model checkpointing.'
description: Model checkpointing periodically saves the state of your machine learning
  model during training, so that it can be restored in case of interruption, failure,
  or termination. For more information, see Boost checkpoint speed and reduce cost
  with Nebula.
