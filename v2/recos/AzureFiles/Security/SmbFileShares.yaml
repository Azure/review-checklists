title: In most cases, you should enable the Secure transfer required option on all
  your storage accounts to enable encryption in transit for SMB file shares. Don't
  enable this option if you need to allow very old clients to access the share. If
  you disable secure transfer, be sure to use network controls to restrict traffic.
description: This setting ensures that all requests that are made against the storage
  account take place over secure connections (HTTPS). Any requests made over HTTP
  will fail.
