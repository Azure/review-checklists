title: 'Minimize the use of storage account keys: Identity-based authentication provides
  superior security compared to using a storage account key. But you must use a storage
  account key to get full administrative control of a file share, including the ability
  to take ownership of a file. Grant security principals only the necessary permissions
  that they need to perform their tasks.'
