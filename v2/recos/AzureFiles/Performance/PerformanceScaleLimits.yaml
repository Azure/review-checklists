title: 'Create storage accounts in the same regions as connecting clients to reduce
  latency: The farther you are from the Azure Files service, the greater the latency
  and the more difficult to achieve performance scale limits. This consideration is
  especially true when you access Azure Files from on-premises environments. If possible,
  ensure that your storage account and your clients are co-located in the same Azure
  region. Optimize for on-premises clients by minimizing network latency or by using
  an ExpressRoute connection to extend on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud
  over a private connection.'
