title: 'Understand how your bill is calculated: Standard Azure file shares provide
  a pay-as-you-go model. Premium shares use a provisioned model in which you specify
  and pay for a certain amount of capacity, IOPS, and throughput up front. In the
  pay-as-you-go model, meters track the amount of data that''s stored in the account,
  or the capacity, and the number and type of transactions based on your usage of
  that data. The pay-as-you-go model can be cost efficient because you pay only for
  what you use. With the pay-as-you-go model, you don''t need to overprovision or
  deprovision storage based on performance requirements or demand fluctuations.'
