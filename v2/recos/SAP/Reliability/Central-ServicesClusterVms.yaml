title: Use Site Recovery to replicate an application server to a DR site. Site Recovery
  can also help with replicating central-services cluster VMs to the DR site. When
  you invoke DR, you'll need to reconfigure the Linux Pacemaker cluster on the DR
  site (for example, replace the VIP or SBD, run corosync.conf, and more).
