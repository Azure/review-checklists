title: You can use Azure shared disks in Windows for ASCS + SCS components and specific
  high-availability scenarios. Set up your failover clusters separately for SAP application
  layer components and the DBMS layer. Azure doesn't currently support high-availability
  architectures that combine SAP application layer components and the DBMS layer into
  one failover cluster.
