title: 'Workload architecture: Maintain small and optimized images.'
description: Streamlining your images helps reduce costs since new nodes need to download
  these images. Build images in a way that allows the container start as soon as possible
  to help avoid user request failures or timeouts while the application is starting
  up, potentially leading to overprovisioning.
