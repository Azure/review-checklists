name: revcl-DatabaseManagementSystemExcessiveNetworkTraffic
title: It isn't recommended to host the database management system (DBMS) and application
  layers of SAP systems in different VNets and connect them with VNet peering because
  of the substantial costs that excessive network traffic between the layers can produce.
  Recommend using subnets within the Azure virtual network to separate the SAP application
  layer and DBMS layer.
