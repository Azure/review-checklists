name: revcl-MaximumNetworkThroughputSapLandingZones
title: Virtual WAN manages connectivity between spoke VNets for virtual-WAN-based
  topologies (no need to set up user-defined routing [UDR] or NVAs), and maximum network
  throughput for VNet-to-VNet traffic in the same virtual hub is 50 gigabits per second.
  If necessary, SAP landing zones can use VNet peering to connect to other landing
  zones and overcome this bandwidth limitation.
