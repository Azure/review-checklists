title: You should run SAP HANA on Azure only on the types of storage that are certified
  by SAP. Note that certain volumes must be run on certain disk configurations, where
  applicable. These configurations include enabling Write Accelerator and using Premium
  storage. You also need to ensure that the file system that runs on storage is compatible
  with the DBMS that runs on the machine.
