title: If you're using SAP SuccessFactors, consider using the Azure AD automated user
  provisioning. With this integration, as you add new employees to SAP SuccessFactors,
  you can automatically create their user accounts in Azure AD. Optionally, you can
  create user accounts in Microsoft 365 or other SaaS applications that are supported
  by Azure AD. Use write-back of the email address to SAP SuccessFactors.
