title: (Scale set) Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Flexible orchestration mode can help
  simplify the deployment and management of your workload. For example, you can easily
  manage self-healing by using automatic repairs.
description: Flexible orchestration can manage VM instances at scale. Handing individual
  VMs adds operational overhead.  For example, when you delete VM instances, the associated
  disks and NICs are also automatically deleted. VM instances are spread across multiple
  fault domains so that update operations don't disrupt service.
