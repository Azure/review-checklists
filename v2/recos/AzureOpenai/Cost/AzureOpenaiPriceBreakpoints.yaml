title: 'Usage optimization: Maximize Azure OpenAI price breakpoints, for example,
  fine-tuning and model breakpoints like image generation. Because fine-tuning is
  charged per hour, use as much time as you have available per hour to improve fine-tuning
  results while avoiding slipping into the next billing period. Similarly, the cost
  for generating 100 images is the same as the cost for 1 image. Maximize price breakpoints
  to your advantage.'
