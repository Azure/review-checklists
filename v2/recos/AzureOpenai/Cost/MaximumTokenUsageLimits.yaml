title: 'Usage optimization: Consider model pricing and capabilities when you choose
  models. Start with less-costly models for less-complex tasks like text generation
  or completion tasks. For more complex tasks like language translation or content
  understanding, consider using more advanced models. Consider different model capabilities
  and maximum token usage limits when you choose a model that''s appropriate for use
  cases like text embedding, image generation, or transcription scenarios. By carefully
  selecting the model that best fits your needs, you can optimize costs while still
  achieving the desired application performance.'
