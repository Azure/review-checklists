title: 'Microsoft Entra ID: Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and to authorize
  access to Azure OpenAI by using role-based access control (RBAC). Disable local
  authentication in Azure AI Services and set `disableLocalAuth` to `true`. Grant
  identities that perform completions or image generation the Cognitive Services OpenAI
  User role. Grant model automation pipelines and ad-hoc data-science access a role
  like Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor.'
description: Using Microsoft Entra ID centralizes the identity-management component
  and eliminates the use of API keys. Using RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID ensures that
  users or groups have exactly the permissions they need to do their job. This kind
  of fine-grained access control isn't possible with Azure OpenAI API keys.
