title: 'Capacity: Select a model that aligns with your performance requirements, considering
  the tradeoff between speed and output complexity. Model performance can vary significantly
  based on the chosen model type. Models designed for speed offer faster response
  times, which can be beneficial for applications that require quick interactions.
  Conversely, more sophisticated models might deliver higher-quality outputs at the
  expense of increased response time.'
