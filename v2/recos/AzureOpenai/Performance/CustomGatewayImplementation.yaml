title: 'Capacity: Allocate PTUs to cover your predicted usage, and complement these
  PTUs with a TPM deployment to handle elasticity above that limit. This approach
  combines base throughput with elastic throughput for efficiency. Like other considerations,
  this approach requires a custom gateway implementation to route requests to the
  TPM deployment when the PTU limits are reached.'
