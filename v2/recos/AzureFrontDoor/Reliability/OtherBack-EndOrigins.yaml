title: Support redundancy by having multiple origins in one or more back-end pools.
  Always have redundant instances of your application and make sure each instance
  exposes an endpoint or origin. You can place those origins in one or more back-end
  pools.
description: Multiple origins support redundancy by distributing traffic across multiple
  instances of the application. If one instance is unavailable, then other back-end
  origins can still receive traffic.
