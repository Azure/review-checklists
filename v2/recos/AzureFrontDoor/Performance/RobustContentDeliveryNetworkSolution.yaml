title: Enable caching.  You can optimize query strings for caching. For purely static
  content, ignore query strings to maximize your use of the cache.  If your application
  uses query strings, consider including them in the cache key. Including the query
  strings in the cache key allows Azure Front Door to serve cached responses or other
  responses, based on your configuration.
description: Azure Front Door offers a robust content delivery network solution that
  caches content at the edge of the network. Caching reduces the load on the back-end
  servers and reduces data movement across the network, which helps offload bandwidth
  usage.
