title: Restrict default access to Azure NetApp Files volumes
description: Access to the delegated subnet should be limited to specific Azure Virtual
  Networks. SMB-enabled volumes' share permissions should move away from 'Everyone/Full
  control'. NFS-enabled volumes' access needs to be controlled via export policies
  and/or NFSv4.1 ACLs.
