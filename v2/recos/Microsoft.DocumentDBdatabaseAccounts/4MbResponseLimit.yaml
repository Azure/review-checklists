title: Ensure query results are fully drained
description: Cosmos DB has a 4 MB response limit, leading to paginated results for
  large or partition-spanning queries. Each page shows availability and provides a
  continuation token for the next. A while loop in code is necessary to traverse all
  pages until completion.
